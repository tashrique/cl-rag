UC Berkeley,"Source: nan, Attribute: GPA requirements","""**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley requires a strong academic record. While the minimum eligibility to apply is a 3.0 GPA in UC-required courses for California residents (3.4 for non-residents) , successful applicants typically far exceed this. In fact, to be competitive at Berkeley, students generally need an academic profile much stronger than the UC minimums . **Historical Perspective:** Admitted freshmen almost all earn A grades in high school – the middle 50% of Berkeley’s Fall 2024 admitted class had unweighted GPAs between 3.89 and 4.00 (nearly straight A’s) and weighted GPAs up to about 4.65 . The average unweighted GPA was about 3.92, with a 4.47 weighted GPA, for Fall 2024 admits, slightly higher than the prior year (4.44) . This upward trend in admitted GPA reflects increasing competition. **Specific Data Points:** Back in Fall 2019, the admit rate was ~16% with a middle 50% weighted GPA around 4.15–4.30 ; by Fall 2024 the admit rate dropped to ~11% and average GPAs rose above 4.4. Berkeley considers both weighted and unweighted GPAs, looking at performance in required “A-G” courses in 10th-11th grade and beyond. They assess not just the GPA number but also the rigor of coursework – the number of Honors, AP, IB, or college-level classes a student took, and performance relative to what was available at their school . **Holistic Nuances:** GPA is evaluated in context: readers examine grade trends (improvement or consistency), the difficulty of courses, and how the student maximized opportunities. There is no fixed “cut-off” GPA for admission, but given Berkeley’s large applicant pool, admitted students’ GPAs tend to be very high. The admissions office emphasizes that strong academics are necessary but not sufficient – nearly all applicants meet the minimum GPA, so Berkeley uses comprehensive review to go “beyond the numbers” when comparing students ."",""2025"","" ; ; [oai_citation_attribution:11‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=desirable%20destination%20for%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s",2025-03-08

That said, international applicants are automatically considered for certain merit scholarships during admission — notably the prestigious Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholarship — although only a very small number of international students receive these awards . Generally, international undergraduates must rely on personal and family funding, but they can seek out scholarships from private sources or their home country to help finance their studies . UC Berkeley’s Berkeley International Office provides guidance on funding and even administers a few need-based awards and emergency loans for international students with unexpected financial hardship .

UC Berkeley,"Source: nan, Attribute: Extracurricular evaluation","""**Expanded Explanation:** Berkeley conducts a holistic review that places substantial emphasis on **extracurricular involvement, leadership, and achievements** outside the classroom. Rather than requiring specific activities, the admissions readers assess how each applicant chose to spend their time and **what impact or accomplishments** they achieved in those pursuits . This includes traditional extracurriculars (like clubs, student government, sports, arts, and community service) as well as work experience, family responsibilities, or unique hobbies. The key is **quality and depth over quantity**: sustained commitment or notable achievements in a few areas can stand out more than superficial involvement in many. **Historical Perspective:** Over the past five years, as the applicant pool has grown and test scores were removed from consideration, Berkeley has increasingly highlighted the importance of non-academic factors. The university pioneered holistic review in the UC system, focusing on building a diverse class with varied talents and backgrounds . This means that strong extracurriculars and personal qualities have long been important, but they may carry even more weight now in differentiating top students. Berkeley has seen applicants with leadership roles in community initiatives, significant research or coding projects, standout athletic talent, or other exceptional extracurricular accomplishments, and these experiences often complement academic strength in admissions decisions. **Specific Data Points:** There is no formula for extracurriculars, but the profile of admitted students shows high involvement: for example, a large portion of Berkeley freshmen have participated in leadership or volunteer work, and many have earned awards or distinctions in arts, science, or other fields (though the university does not publish a numeric breakdown of activities, these elements are reflected qualitatively in the *comprehensive review*). **Holistic Nuances:** Evaluators consider extracurricular achievements in the **context** of each applicant’s opportunities . They ask questions like: Did the student show initiative or hold leadership roles (formally or informally)? Did they achieve something significant or demonstrate passion and growth? How did the student balance commitments, especially if they faced obligations like part-time jobs or family care? Importantly, Berkeley defines leadership broadly – “leadership” can mean being a team captain or club president, but it can also be demonstrated through initiating a project, mentoring others, or overcoming challenges . The admissions guidelines explicitly recognize *“exemplary, sustained achievement in any field of intellectual or creative endeavor; accomplishments in extracurricular activities such as the performing arts or athletics; leadership in school or community organizations; employment; and volunteer service”* as positives in an application . In summary, Berkeley looks for meaningful engagement: applicants who have made a positive impact or shown dedication beyond academics are viewed favorably, especially when those contributions align with their passions and the values of the university."",""2025"","" ; ; [oai_citation_attribution:46‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=Each%20application%20undergoes%20a%20holistic",2025-03-08

UC Berkeley,"Source: nan, Attribute: Special admissions considerations","""**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley employs policies to ensure that students with unique backgrounds, challenges, or talents are given fair consideration. The admissions process explicitly **does not consider race, ethnicity, gender, or religion** in compliance with California law (Proposition 209) . However, Berkeley **does consider the context** of each applicant’s life – factors like being a first-generation college student, coming from a low-income family or a rural area, attending a disadvantaged school, or overcoming significant hardship or disability are all taken into account as part of the holistic review . Readers assess achievements “in light of the opportunities available” to the student and will note if an applicant has shown determination and resilience in the face of personal challenges . **Historical Perspective:** Over the past five years, there have been ongoing efforts to broaden access. In 2020, a state ballot measure (Prop 16) sought to reinstate affirmative action but was not passed, so Berkeley continues to pursue diversity through race-neutral means. The university has increased outreach to underrepresented communities and, as noted in 2024 admissions, about 3,800 of the admitted first-year students were from underrepresented minority groups (African American, Latinx, Native American, etc.) despite the ban on considering race . Additionally, Berkeley has steadily enrolled a significant number of first-generation college students (roughly 26% of Fall 2024 admits were first-gen) , indicating its commitment to socioeconomic diversity. **Specific Data Points:** The UC system’s *Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC)* program guarantees UC admission (though not necessarily to Berkeley) for the top 9% of students in each California high school. Berkeley gives special attention to ELC-designated applicants as part of its comprehensive review, recognizing their achievement in context. Moreover, UC policy allows for *“Admission by Exception”* – up to 6% of an incoming class can be admitted despite not meeting every UC minimum requirement, if they possess exceptional talent or come from a disadvantaged background . In practice, Berkeley uses this for cases like outstanding athletes, artists, or students who experienced extreme hardship that affected part of their academics. Such candidates must still demonstrate potential to succeed at Berkeley. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s review readers are trained to evaluate each file in context. They consider if the applicant had limited access to advanced courses or extracurriculars and how they made use of what was available. If an applicant has faced unusual circumstances (for example, homelessness, refugee status, significant family responsibilities, or a disability), the review will weigh the *“maturity, determination and insight”* shown in overcoming those challenges . To gather more information on special cases, Berkeley can invoke the **Augmented Review** process: a small percentage of applicants may be asked to provide additional materials, such as a questionnaire, seventh-semester grades, or up to two recommendation letters, to shed light on *“extraordinary circumstances or special talents”* . (Notably, UC Berkeley normally does *not* accept recommendation letters, except when an Augmented Review is triggered for a particular applicant.) **Official Validation:** All these special considerations operate within UC’s formal guidelines. For example, Regents policy caps *non-resident* enrollment (to prioritize Californians) and state law mandates race-blind admissions, but Berkeley still achieves diversity through holistic review. The **Berkeley Admissions Office and UC Office of the President** regularly report statistics on first-gen students, low-income students, and other groups to ensure transparency . In summary, while academic excellence is key, Berkeley’s process actively accommodates **individual circumstances and exceptional talents** to admit a diverse, well-rounded freshman class."",""2025"","" ; ; ; [oai_citation_attribution:63‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Letters%20of%20recommendation%20can%20be",2025-03-08

UC Berkeley,"Source: nan, Attribute: Changes over the past five years","""**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley’s admissions have become **more competitive and evolved** in policy from 2020 through 2025. The university saw a significant **increase in applications** – from about 87,000 freshman applicants in Fall 2019 to roughly 125,000+ in Fall 2022-2023 – which led to lower admit rates and higher academic benchmarks. In recent cycles, Berkeley’s freshman **admit rate has hovered around 11%** , down from 16–17% five years ago . Alongside this growth, UC Berkeley (and the UC system at large) made major policy shifts: **Standardized tests were eliminated.** In 2020, the UC Regents approved dropping the SAT/ACT requirement; by Fall 2021 admissions, Berkeley went test-optional due to the pandemic, and soon after became fully **test-blind** (not considering scores at all) . A legal agreement in 2021 ensured no UC would use test scores through 2025, and ultimately UC decided to make the change permanent. This was one of the most impactful changes in the last five years. **Historical Perspective:** The COVID-19 pandemic (2020) also forced temporary adjustments: UC suspended letter-grade requirements for A-G courses in Spring 2020 (allowing Pass/No Pass grades without penalty) and extended admissions deadlines to accommodate students . Those measures were emergency responses and have since expired, but they set the stage for more flexible, holistic considerations (and underscored the value of looking beyond test scores). In terms of admissions strategy, Berkeley has also responded to public pressure and state mandates to prioritize California residents. **Specific Data Points:** In 2021, the California state budget and UC Board pushed campuses like Berkeley to increase in-state enrollment. As a result, Berkeley’s Fall 2024 admitted class was 79% California residents, up from 75% the year before , reflecting a deliberate shift to admit more Californians. Another notable change occurred in early 2022 when a court-ordered **enrollment cap** threatened to force Berkeley to reduce admissions; this led to swift legislative action that allowed the university to resume normal admission volumes . Berkeley did, however, slightly reduce the number of admission offers in 2024 to better control enrollment after higher-than-expected yields in prior years . Over five years, the **academic profile** of admitted students has remained extremely high or risen – for instance, the average unweighted GPA of admits held around 3.92 , and the average fully weighted GPA increased (from roughly 4.4 to 4.47 between 2020 and 2024) . Meanwhile, metrics like test scores are no longer tracked, and more emphasis is placed on qualitative factors. **Holistic Nuances:** With each passing year, Berkeley has doubled down on **holistic review**. The removal of tests meant readers consider personal insight essays and extracurriculars even more intensively to gauge traits like leadership, creativity, and resilience. During the pandemic, readers were mindful of applicants’ limited opportunities for activities or testing, and adjusted expectations accordingly. The university also updated its **Augmented Review** policy (in 2017, refined in 2022) to allow seeking additional context (including recommendation letters) for up to 15% of borderline cases , ensuring no student is overlooked due to unusual circumstances. In summary, the 2020–2025 period has seen Berkeley admissions become **more selective** and adapt to external challenges: testing was phased out, application numbers hit new highs, and policies were tweaked to maintain fairness and a strong commitment to in-state students. The class entering Fall 2025 will be the culmination of these trends – a class chosen entirely without test scores, with record-high applications, and with a composition shaped by the university’s focus on diversity, excellence, and resilience."",""2025"","" ; ; ; [oai_citation_attribution:82‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=California%20residents%20admitted%20in%20alignment",2025-03-08

Berkeley also administers the Berkeley Undergraduate Scholarship program, which awards thousands of undergraduates based on a combination of high GPA and financial need (students with financial need and a GPA below the 3.5 threshold are awarded a University Grant instead ). Additional merit-oriented awards include the Fiat Lux Scholarship (for students from certain underrepresented high schools) and various departmental or donor-sponsored scholarships. Generally, entering students are automatically considered for merit awards through their UC application (no separate application is required for Regents and many other campus scholarships). To keep merit scholarships, students must meet renewal requirements (e.g., maintain a minimum GPA and full-time enrollment) .

UC Berkeley,"Source: are%20separate%20from%20admission%20requirements), Attribute: Changes Over the Past Five Years","""UC Berkeley's admissions policies have evolved significantly since 2020. The most notable change was the elimination of standardized test scores: the UC system made SAT/ACT optional for Fall 2021 applicants and then completely test-blind from Fall 2022 onward following a Regents decision and legal settlement . By late 2021 UC announced it would not consider SAT/ACT at all for future cycles a policy in effect for Fall 2025 admissions and beyond. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted temporary adjustments: for applicants in 2020 and 2021 UC relaxed grading requirements by accepting Pass/No Pass grades for A-G high school courses and for transfer prerequisites without penalty . Application readers also remained mindful of pandemic-related disruptions to activities and academics . In the past five years Berkeley has doubled down on holistic review placing greater emphasis on qualitative factors like the PIQs and extracurriculars in the absence of test scores. Other changes include new undergraduate colleges/majors (e.g. a new Data Science college) with updated requirements and adjustments in transfer policy (for example for Fall 2025 Berkeley's College of Letters & Science no longer requires full general education completion prior to transfer aligning with the seven-course pattern requirement) . Throughout these years Berkeley's overarching goal of broad-based excellence and diversity in admissions has remained constant but the evaluation process has become more flexible and context-driven in response to these changes."",2021,UC Regents Press Release 2020 ; UC Admissions COVID-19 FAQ [oai_citation_attribution:50‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/response-covid-19.html#:~:text=I%20had%20to%20take%20units",2025-03-08

UC Berkeley,"Source: nan, Attribute: Standardized test policies","""**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley is **test-free** in admissions, meaning SAT and ACT scores are **not considered at all** during application review . This policy applies to all freshman applicants as part of the University of California system’s shift away from standardized testing. **Historical Perspective:** In May 2020, the UC Board of Regents voted to suspend SAT/ACT requirements and planned a phase-out over five years . Initially, for Fall 2021 and 2022 applicants, tests were optional, and by Fall 2023 the UC system moved to **test-blind** admissions (scores, even if submitted, could not be used) . A subsequent legal settlement accelerated this timeline, so **since Fall 2021 Berkeley has not used SAT/ACT scores at all**. By 2022, UC decided not to develop a new exam, making the test-free policy permanent. **Specific Data Points:** Prior to these changes, admitted Berkeley students had very high test scores – for example, the middle 50% of Fall 2019 admits scored 30–35 on the ACT, and about 1340–1540 (combined) on the SAT . Now, with tests eliminated, Berkeley places greater weight on academics, essays, and extracurricular achievements. The university will still consider **AP or IB exam scores**, SAT Subject Test scores (when available in the past), or other external exams as **optional supplements** to showcase mastery , but **SAT/ACT scores are entirely excluded** from admission and scholarship decisions. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s comprehensive review ensures that without test scores, other factors like GPA (especially in rigorous courses), leadership, talents, and personal qualities are more closely examined . The removal of standardized tests was partly to broaden access and equity, and officials note that it hasn’t lowered standards, as applicants continue to self-select with strong academic records. As of the Fall 2025 cycle, submitting SAT or ACT scores is neither required nor useful – **Berkeley will not look at them**. Applicants, especially international students from non-English speaking schools, may need to submit TOEFL/IELTS for English proficiency, but **no general standardized tests are used for admission review**."",""2025"","" ; ; [oai_citation_attribution:22‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=",2025-03-08

UC Berkeley,"Source: nan, Attribute: Essay expectations","""**Expanded Explanation:** Applicants to Berkeley must respond to the University of California Personal Insight Questions (PIQs) – a set of short essays that are a **vital part** of the application . Freshman applicants choose **4 out of 8 prompts**, with each response up to **350 words** . These prompts invite students to share personal stories and reflections on leadership, creativity, talents, challenges overcome, and more. **Historical Perspective:** The PIQ format (adopted UC-wide in 2016) has remained consistent over the past five years, but its importance has grown as applications have become more competitive and standardized tests were removed. Admissions officers use the essays to **discover and evaluate distinctions among applicants whose academic records are often very similar** . In other words, with so many students having outstanding grades, the essays help reveal each student’s unique experiences, character, and voice. Berkeley’s readers from both the Admissions and Scholarship offices review these responses , underscoring their significance not just for admission but also for merit awards. **Specific Data Points:** Every applicant answers four PIQs, all given equal consideration (no prompt is favored over another) . Common topics include leadership examples, creative projects, significant challenges, academic passions, or community involvement. Each essay is limited to 350 words, so students must be concise and reflective. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley looks for qualities such as *initiative, motivation, leadership, persistence, service to others,* and cultural awareness through these essays . Readers evaluate **how students have made the most of their opportunities and handled any hardships** . An applicant who writes about a challenge, for instance, should focus on how they overcame it and what they learned . Grammar and writing style are not formally graded, but clarity and thoughtfulness are crucial (students are advised that while writing mechanics won’t be scored, good writing helps presentation) . Berkeley also allows students to use an “Additional Comments” section to provide context beyond the essays, ensuring that they can explain any unusual circumstances or add details about activities if needed . Overall, the PIQs are assessed *holistically* alongside academics and extracurriculars, offering a richer picture of the applicant. Strong essays can tip the balance by highlighting personal qualities and experiences that grades alone cannot show."",""2025"","" ; ; [oai_citation_attribution:37‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/#:~:text=",2025-03-08

UC Berkeley,"Source: nan, Attribute: Domestic/international considerations","""**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley being a public university in California prioritizes **in-state (domestic) students** while also welcoming talented students from across the U.S. and around the world. **Domestic (California residents)** benefit from certain policies: by UC rules, California students need a minimum 3.0 GPA in A-G courses to be eligible to apply, whereas **non-resident** (out-of-state U.S. and international) applicants must have at least a 3.4 GPA in those courses . Additionally, the UC Board of Regents enforces limits on out-of-state and international enrollment. At Berkeley, non-resident undergraduates have been capped at roughly the level they were in 2017 (around 24% of the student body) . In recent freshman classes, this translates to roughly 20-25% of admits being non-California students – for Fall 2024, about 21% of admitted freshmen were from out-of-state or overseas, as 79% were Californians . **International Applicants:** If a student requires a visa to study, Berkeley considers them international. They must meet the same academic standards (completion of a rigorous secondary curriculum with high grades) and **demonstrate English language proficiency** if educated in a non-English environment. UC’s systemwide requirements include exams like TOEFL (minimum score 80 iBT) or IELTS (6.5+) to show English proficiency for international students . International transcripts are evaluated according to country-specific contexts – for instance, A-levels, IB diplomas, or national exam results are considered alongside or in lieu of a GPA, and UC provides guidelines for different countries’ educational systems. **Out-of-State Applicants:** Students from other U.S. states are held to the same holistic criteria as Californians. There is no admission preference given to non-residents; in fact, because non-resident enrollment is capped, out-of-state applicants face a competitive process for a limited number of spots. That said, out-of-state admits at Berkeley often have academic credentials on par with the top in-state students (since all applicants compete in the same pool). **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s comprehensive review weighs achievements in context for all students, but readers will consider an applicant’s environment – for example, if an international student had to learn English recently or an out-of-state student comes from an underserved region, those factors become part of the context. No quotas exist for specific states or countries, but Berkeley strives for geographic diversity as a secondary goal. The Fall 2024 admitted students, for example, hailed from **57 U.S. states and territories and 115 countries**, indicating a broad reach . **Special Policies:** California residents have programs like Eligibility in Local Context (top 9% of their high school) which can boost their UC chances, whereas non-residents do not have ELC. Financial considerations do not directly factor into admission, but international and out-of-state students must show they can afford higher non-resident tuition (Berkeley is need-blind for U.S. students, but international applicants are not offered need-based aid). Importantly, **all applications are reviewed with the same criteria**, and every applicant, domestic or international, is expected to demonstrate academic excellence and personal accomplishments. The additional requirements for non-residents (higher GPA threshold and English testing) ensure they are prepared for Berkeley’s rigor. In summary, Berkeley maintains a balance: honoring its public mission to educate Californians first, while also selecting outstanding students globally who enrich the campus with diverse perspectives . The admissions outcomes reflect this balance, shaped by state policy (caps on non-residents) and holistic review that puts all applicants on an equal footing in terms of evaluation of merit."",""2025"","" ; ; ; [oai_citation_attribution:93‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/international-applicants/english-language-proficiency-toefl-ielts.html#:~:text=",2025-03-08

Low-income California students (family income under $80,000) are covered by the UC Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, ensuring that their systemwide tuition is fully paid through grants and scholarships . In addition, UCSD undergraduates with high financial need receive federal Pell Grants, Cal Grants from the state of California, and UC San Diego institutional grants to cover educational expenses. UCSD’s philosophy is need-blind in admissions and aims to meet students’ financial need through a combination of gift aid (grants/scholarships), work-study employment, and student loans . A typical low-income package will include generous grant aid and a work-study job opportunity, with remaining need often filled by a subsidized Direct Loan. Students must submit the FAFSA or California Dream Act Application by the priority deadline (March 2) to be considered for all need-based programs. To maximize aid, low-income students should apply on time, submit any required documents, and also search for outside scholarships that can supplement UCSD’s aid.

The most prestigious is the UCSD Regents Scholarship, a purely merit-based award given to entering first-year and transfer students who have demonstrated academic excellence; it provides $5,000 per year for up to four years (a total of $20,000) and comes with special privileges like priority course enrollment and guaranteed housing . Another major award is the Chancellor’s Scholarship, which is awarded to outstanding California resident freshmen based on merit and financial need – it offers up to $5,000 per year (renewable for 4 years) for students who maintain eligibility . UCSD also has other merit scholarships such as the Ellen and Roger Revelle Scholarship (a $10,000 award over four years for top freshmen) and various restricted scholarships that target students with specific interests or backgrounds. Merit scholarships are very competitive and are awarded through the admissions process; no separate application is required for Regents or Chancellor’s scholarships (students are automatically considered based on their UC application) . To retain these scholarships, students must uphold the stipulated GPA (often around 3.0) and full-time enrollment each year. UCSD encourages students to also pursue outside scholarships to supplement any institutional awards, and provides resources to help locate private scholarships. Emphasizing your academic accomplishments, leadership roles, and unique experiences in your application can improve your chances for merit-based awards at UCSD.""",2024

International students on F-1/J-1 visas are not eligible to apply for UCSD’s university, state, or federal financial aid programs . Admitted international undergraduates must certify that they have sufficient funds available to cover all tuition, fees, and living expenses for their studies (on the order of tens of thousands of dollars per year) . In practice, this means UCSD expects international students to self-fund their education. The university does provide guidance on potential funding sources: UCSD’s International Students & Programs Office and the Financial Aid Office direct students to external scholarships and resources geared toward international students . However, UCSD’s own merit scholarships (such as Regents and Chancellor’s) are generally restricted to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or AB540-eligible students, so international students are usually not recipients of those awards. International students may consider private education loans (which require a U.S. co-signer) or scholarships from organizations in their home country to help finance their UCSD education. They can also work on campus up to 20 hours a week as allowed by visa rules to earn some supplemental income. Ultimately, because UC San Diego cannot offer need-based aid to international undergraduates, affordability planning and securing funding in advance is essential for international students.""",2024

For California residents, the state’s Middle Class Scholarship program can significantly help families with incomes up to around $200,000 by covering a portion of university costs after other aid is applied . This means that eligible middle-income UCSD students may see some of their loan or work-study requirements reduced thanks to the MCS program . In addition, students from middle-income families who demonstrate financial need might qualify for a Cal Grant A (which covers tuition for eligible middle-income Californians) , as well as institutional support if their FAFSA indicates remaining need. However, middle-income aid packages at UCSD often include a higher proportion of self-help: Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans, parent PLUS loans, and expected family contribution. California residents should always apply for aid by March 2 to be considered for programs like Cal Grants and MCS. Non-resident U.S. students are not eligible for California-funded aid (like Cal Grants or MCS) and generally rely on federal loans and any merit scholarships. Middle-income families are encouraged to plan ahead with college savings, utilize UCSD’s interest-free installment payment plans, and seek external scholarships to help bridge any remaining financial gap.""",2024

Selection criteria for these awards typically involve outstanding academics, extracurricular leadership, and personal character. Recipients must maintain good academic standing (e.g., a minimum 3.0 GPA and full-time enrollment) to renew their awards each year.

All students should still apply for aid by the March 2 deadline to be considered for every program. It’s important to note that UCLA cannot offer state-funded awards like Cal Grants or the Middle Class Scholarship to non-California residents , so out-of-state middle-income students generally rely on federal aid, university scholarships, and family contributions.
