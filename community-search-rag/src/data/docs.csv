In 2019; when the CDE opened up a 60 day Community Input Process about the new Health Framework; community leaders and clergy started recognizing many controversial terms in the document. Due to the controversy; as founder of the Interfaith Statewide Coalition; I started speaking in many Spanish; Arabic and Asian places of worship encouraging them to be part of the statewide process. Many Hispanic immigrant parents asked for the document in Spanish. I told them I would get that from the CDE; but when I requested it; they said the document is only available in English. This shocked me. The CDE said immigrants can use google translate for the 1;000 page document and said that any comments turned in that were not in English; would not be included in the summary provided to the State Board of Education before their vote. This shocked me. Due to this discrimination of non-English immigrant parents; I filed a complaint against the CDE through the Office of Civil Rights with the help of lawyers. Justice still has not been done. A Spanish Newspaper in Southern California published my story about it. The Health Framework defined gender as ever-expansive and ever-changing. It also introduced a term spiritual abuse defined as Using religion to justify rigid gender roles such as binary male and female. This implies that ones sincerely held beliefs can label someone abusive.,07-Mar-2025

We must act now to create a master plan for climate-resilient schools."", ""university"": ""Unknown""}",The new administration has big plans; any of which could have a major impact on California education. But could is the key word. So; we will stay on top of whats happening and it will inform our coverage as it affects California. How are federal decisions affecting students; educators; and families here? Will school funding or instruction shift? How are California policymakers adjusting to the new landscape? As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. When Los Angeles teachers welcomed students back to school in January; they couldnt have imagined what lay ahead. Within days; climate-fueled wildfires would tear through Altadena; Pasadena and the Palisades; destroying or damaging twelve schools and disrupting education for more than 600;000 students across the region. Unfortunately; in the years to come; the climate disasters that are already impacting our schools will worsen. In California; our leaders have the power to chart our own path to healthier; more climate-resilient school buildings  with or without federal support. The LA fires provide a stark reminder of how unprepared many of Californias schools are for climate change. Beyond lacking fire-resistant building materials that could have mitigated damage; schools also lack necessities: cooling systems for heat waves and air filtration systems for smoke. Lack of cooling is a statewide challenge  between 15 and 20 of Californias K-12 public schools have no functioning air conditioning at all; and another 10 need major repairs to or replacement of their heating; ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. But out of this crisis; solutions are emerging. Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD); our nations second-biggest school district; is turning crisis into opportunity. Instead of simply rebuilding damaged schools; the district is creating a blueprint for climate resilience that should inspire educational leaders across California. The district is investing in fire-resistant building materials; schoolyard greening projects; and modern HVAC systems to combat increasingly frequent heat waves and filter wildfire smoke and pollutants. While some initiatives were already underway prior to the fires; new investments will be supported by the districts 9 billion bond that Los Angeles voters approved in November and Proposition 2; the state school infrastructure bond also approved by voters last year. For the first time; the Legislature explicitly allowed districts to use this funding to create safer outdoor learning environments; strengthen vulnerable infrastructure; and advance state energy goals. LAUSDs progress is encouraging; but California cant afford to wait for a district-by-district approach to climate resilience. California needs immediate statewide action to protect all students. Two key steps are essential: First; we need better state planning and coordination. California currently spends billions annually on school infrastructure; but much of this funding isnt aligned with climate resilience; indoor air quality; or emissions reduction goals. By allocating 10 million to the California Department of Education to build local capacity and provide regional support through county offices of education; we will build necessary support systems to assist school districts in planning for climate-resilient campuses. California has already wasted precious time. For two years; weve worked with the Legislature on a proposal for a state master plan for climate-resilient schools; only to face Gov. Gavin Newsoms veto twice over cost concerns; despite strong bipartisan support and a moderate cost of 10 million. This delay puts our childrens safety at risk. This year; we must finally get it done. Second; districts need comprehensive facilities master plans that address indoor air quality; climate resilience; and cost-effective electrification. Students need a California where every school district is armed with a detailed blueprint for creating climate-resilient facilities; and has the support and funding they need to implement these plans. Implementation guidelines for Proposition 2 are being developed now and should include guidance for school districts to develop these plans with climate readiness at the core. State leaders could also prioritize and leverage Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds administered by the California Air Resources Board; a program that collects money from the states cap-and-trade initiative to invest in projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions; to support much-needed HVAC upgrades and nudge districts to choose modern electric technologies. A previous generation of state leaders made sure schools could keep our children safe in an earthquake  its time to do the same for the threats posed by extreme heat and weather. No school district should be investing state or local dollars in their facilities without considering current and long-term local climate impacts. Jonathan Klein is the CEO and co-founder of UndauntedK12; a national nonprofit working to ensure that every student has the opportunity to attend a safe; healthy and resilient school. Andra Yeghoian is the chief innovation officer of Ten Strands; a San Francisco-based nonprofit whose mission is to build and strengthen the partnerships and strategies that bring environmental literacy to all Californias students.

But could is the key word. So; we will stay on top of whats happening and it will inform our coverage as it affects California. How are federal decisions affecting students; educators; and families here? Will school funding or instruction shift? How are California policymakers adjusting to the new landscape? As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. After operating for the last six years as an affiliate of a nearby community college; California Indian Nations College (CINC) appears likely to become the states only standalone; fully accredited tribal college. Its something education experts say would be a boon for Native American students who now start and complete college at lower rates than other ethnic groups. But first; money has to be found to ensure the college can survive; let alone expand and build its own campus. A two-year and mostly online institution based in the Coachella Valley in Riverside County; the college achieved a big step forward toward its goals recently. It got preliminary approval for accreditation; allowing it to independently offer classes and transferable credits and distribute financial aid. The college expects to have full accreditation within the next year. The college opened its doors in fall 2018 as an extension of UC Riverside for one semester. Since 2019; its degrees have been awarded via a partnership with College of the Desert. Students dually enroll at both campuses; though starting next semester students will be able to enroll solely at CINC and still get an accredited degree. College of the Desert also provides classroom space for the tribal college at its temporary Palm Springs campus; made up of a set of trailers. Inside the tribal colleges classroom trailer; visitors can find Native crafts such as dream catchers; fliers with information about transferring to four-year colleges and even a makeshift basic needs center  a filing cabinet with dry food. CINC enrolls about 150 students and is planning for many more; but it faces an uncertain future even if it achieves full accreditation. It is running low on money and is asking the state for a 60 million infusion in this years budget: 50 million to build its own campus and another 10 million in annual funding for operational costs. Officials say the money is necessary for the college to grow long term and offer a culturally relevant education to Native students who often distrust the U.S. education system. That distrust dates back to the 19th century; when the government began to forcibly send Native children to boarding schools intended to assimilate them; a practice that didnt end until the late 1960s. Theres so many of us here who feel a void and think; Who are we? So having an institution thats empowering and teaching us the truth about who we are is really important; said Mayra Grajeda Nelson; who graduated last year from CINC with an associate degree in sociology and another in social and behavioral sciences. Originally from Banning; Grajeda Nelson now works as a health educator for the Indian Health Council in northern San Diego County. The college is not a typical community college governed by the states board of governors; instead; even with state funding; it would remain chartered by the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians; a federally recognized tribe in Southern California. It would be the only accredited tribal college in the state but not the first. D-Q University operated in Davis from the early 1970s until closing in 2005 after losing accreditation and eligibility for 1 million in federal funding. Across the country; there are more than 30 accredited tribal colleges and universities; spread out across the Southwest; Midwest and other regions. The first tribally controlled college; Diné College in Arizona; was established in 1968 and still operates. California has the largest Native population of any state; with a concentration of tribes in the desert regions of Riverside County. Yet; American Indian or Alaska Native individuals have the lowest college-going rate of any racial or ethnic group in the state; according to a report published in December by the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center at Cal State San Marcos. But if you look at American Indian students who go to tribal colleges or universities; theyre four times more likely to earn their bachelors degree; said Shawn Ragan; CINCs chief operations officer. In a recent report following a campus visit; the accrediting commission praised the tribal college for providing culturally sensitive; academically rigorous courses and degrees that incorporate Native American culture and for fostering an environment where both Indigenous and non-Native students can thrive. The report found that CINC has solid financial planning in place for the short-range and noted that the college is still figuring out its long-term funding planning. Otherwise; the commission found only minor problems that college leaders say will be easy to address; such as requiring the colleges board of trustees to undergo a self-evaluation. California lawmakers; though; have not committed to providing funding this year for CINC; and no funding was included in Gov. Gavin Newsoms January budget proposal. Assemblymember David Alvarez; chair of the state Assemblys budget subcommittee on education; said in an interview that hes supportive of the tribal college and that there is room for conversation about funding. But he acknowledged that the timing is not ideal: Californias public universities are facing budget cuts; and it could be difficult to find money for new spending. To date; the state has given CINC 5 million  a one-time funding allocation in 2022 to help the college apply for accreditation. Now that the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges has awarded the college candidacy status; CINC can also apply for federal funding; but that too is an uncertainty under the Trump administration. President Donald Trump recently rescinded a White House initiative aimed at strengthening tribal colleges. His proposed federal funding freeze; currently blocked by the courts; would also prevent the colleges from getting federal grants and contracts. The Trump administrations hostility to any programs promoting racial diversity could also have a chilling effect and make it harder for those colleges to secure funding. CINC previously received 9 million in seed money from the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians. Most of that has been spent; and the college is now surviving off its reserves; which should last for at least the next year. Open to both Native and non-Native students; the college mostly uses part-time faculty and offers associate degrees in sociology and liberal arts. Students in the liberal arts program can pick one of three concentrations: arts and humanities; business and technology or social and behavioral sciences. In addition to courses specific to their major; students are required to take general education classes as well as six units for a Native American breadth requirement. For that requirement; they choose between courses such as Native American literature; Native performing arts and Native languages. Most classes are online; but the college often holds in-person events; including cultural workshops like basket weaving. There are also talking circles; an Indigenous practice similar to group therapy. Many of the events are led by Kim Marcus; the colleges Elder in Residence and an enrolled Tribal Elder with the Santa Rosa Band of Cahuilla Indians. Grajeda Nelson; the recent graduate; enrolled at CINC in 2023; more than a decade after first enrolling in college at Crafton Hills College in Yucaipa. She also attended Mount San Jacinto College; but didnt receive a degree from either institution. With some credits carrying over from her previous stops; she was able to finish two associate degrees within one year at CINC. During that time; she found the talking circles especially helpful to share her past challenges and get support from people with similar experiences. Thats how the Native community is. Theres that closeness and support because were all kind of dealing with very similar challenges; especially with intergenerational trauma; substance usage; depression; poverty; she said. So having that space gives us time to process those emotions so we dont have to walk away and feel that grief. Kristina Glass; whose family is part of the Cherokee Nation; did make it to and through a non-tribal college; having graduated from Cal State Long Beach in 2014 with a bachelors degree in psychology. In debt and laid off from her job as a graphic designer; Glass last year decided to return to college. Shes pursuing an associate degree in Spanish language from College of the Desert and has been taking general education classes at CINC; including Native American literature. As a student at Cal State Long Beach; Glass said she felt isolated because she didnt meet any other Native students. Her experience at CINC has been much better. Just hearing Native American blessings; performed before events on campus; regularly brings her to tears. Its special; because you feel that connection to this land and these people; she said. Faculty try to incorporate elements of Native culture into the curriculum; even in courses that arent part of the Native breadth requirement. Roseanne Rosenthal; an anthropology professor; instructs students to learn about the history of their tribes from elders in their communities. Having students going back and bringing that knowledge into the classroom; I think is great; said Rosenthal; the colleges only full-time faculty member. If the college can secure more funding; officials plan to add additional full-time faculty and new associate degrees including in business; engineering and food sovereignty. At the top of their wish list; though; is their own campus; which would take a few years to build. In the meantime; the college will continue to use the College of the Desert facility and UC Riversides Palm Desert campus; where CINCs administration is housed. Ragan said the college is still looking at potential sites for a permanent campus but expects to stay in Riverside County. He said having a campus would enable students to come together and build community by having more in-person events and classes and would allow the college to offer more vocational training. He added that the college is looking into additional funding possibilities; such as from other tribes; but said the state is the best option right now. What were asking for; its not a large amount. So ideally well have some wiggle room and can get us added to the budget; he said. California has a tremendous need for tribal colleges. What were doing is historic and is going to change lives.

Keep up to date here as our reporters track those changes and how they may impact California schools and students. While President Donald Trump is still expected to issue an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start the process of abolishing the Education Department; CBS reported; the precise timing of such a move now appears unclear. Sources confirmed that the details of a Wall Street Journal report; which first reported the news; are indeed accurate. According to the Journal; there is a draft version of the executive order. However; White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that no such executive order will be signed Thursday; after CBS News and many other outlets reported it might be. Sources said it was possible the signing would be pushed to a later date. More Fake News! President Trump is NOT signing an Executive Order on the Department of Education today; Leavitt wrote. Eliminating the department would require congressional approval and 60 votes in the Senate; which some deem unlikely given the current makeup; CBS reported. President Trump is widely expected to issue an executive order as soon as today to abolish the Department of Education; according to those briefed on the issue; the Wall Street Journal reported. A draft of the order; viewed by The Wall Street Journal; directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Education Department based on the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law. The order has long been in the works. The Journal reported that the administration was considering such a move in February. The experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollarsand the unaccountable bureaucrats those programs and dollars supporthas failed our children; our teachers; and our families; the draft reads. The draft viewed by the Journal was labeled as pre-decisional; suggesting it might change. The White House didnt respond to a request for comment. McMahon referred to the plan in an email to staff; soon after she was confirmed by the Senate; saying she would send education back to the states. She said American voters had tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of the bureaucratic bloat here at the Education Departmenta momentous final missionquickly and responsibly; the Wall Street Journal reported. The Department of Justice announced Wednesday that it has launched a civil rights probe into allegations of antisemitism at the University of California; saying its attorneys argue there is a potential pattern of discrimination against Jewish employees at the states flagship higher education system; the LA Times reported. The investigation seeks to determine if UC engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination based on race; religion and national origin against its professors; staff and other employees by allowing an antisemitic hostile work environment to exist on its campuses; the department said in a statement. Reports of antisemitism have spiked across the UC system; and college campuses nationwide; since the war in Gaza began. The departments decision did not cite specific cases at UC campuses and did not single out campuses other than a glancing mention of UCLA. This Department of Justice will always defend Jewish Americans; protect civil rights; and leverage our resources to eradicate institutional Antisemitism in our nations universities; Atty. Gen. Pamela Bondi said in the statement. Chad Mizelle; acting associate attorney general and the departments chief of staff; cited a disturbing rise of antisemitism at educational institutions in California and nationwide; the LA Times reported; in a statement. Three teacher preparation groups have banded together to file a lawsuit to overturn the Trump administrations cuts to teacher training grant programs; K-12 Dive reported; arguing that the U.S. Department of Education failed to follow statute and Federal regulations in terminating the grants. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland; the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education; National Center for Teacher Residencies and Maryland Association of Colleges for Teacher Education argue that the departments termination of programs approved by Congress is unlawful. They are seeking reinstatement of the teacher training grants. The grants are funded under three programs appropriated by Congress: the Supporting Effective Educator Development Grant Program; the Teacher Quality Partnership Program and the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program. The lawsuit marks one of the many legal challenges to the latest Trump administration initiatives impacting schools; K-12 Dive reported; ranging from a ban on transgender girls participating in sports to the campaign against DEI guidance in schools. Secretary Linda McMahon clarified one final mission for the Education Department in a message to staff Monday after being sworn in; Politico reported. McMahons plan would enforce President Donald Trumps wish to send education back to the states amid an expected executive order that would task the department with offloading programs to other agencies and assess what laws are needed to close the department. Our job is to respect the will of the American people and the President they elected; who has tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education  a momentous final mission  quickly and responsibly; McMahon wrote. She acknowledged that this process would profoundly impact staff; budgets; and agency operations and added that Congress and other federal departments would be involved. In coming months; we will partner with Congress and other federal agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the expectations of the President and the American people; she wrote. We will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy so that our colleges; K-12 schools; students; and teachers can innovate and thrive. The secretary also delineated some key tenets: centering parents as the decision-makers in a childs education; keeping diversity programming out of public education and focusing on core subjects. This is our opportunity to perform one final; unforgettable public service to future generations of students; McMahon said; Politico reported. I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will all be able to say that we left American education freer; stronger; and with more hope for the future. Student leaders from the campus organization Puente hosted a walkout at Las Positas College in Livermore in protest of the Trump administrations immigration policies Monday afternoon. Puente is a cohort-based program at several California Community Colleges that provides transfer services and other resources for educationally disadvantaged students; specifically Hispanic and Latino students. The event was organized by Puente President Yasmin Martinez Portilla; Vice President Kerlyn Diaz and Secretary Brittany Robles Camacho. At 1:30 p.m.; students and professors began leaving classrooms with decorated banners and signs to walk around the campus before stopping at the front of the campus; near the Las Positas College sign. There; several students gave speeches in support of immigration rights while denouncing President Donald Trumps immigration policies. About 50 students; staff and other community members attended. The purpose of this protest is to show that there (are) people standing together and fighting for the immigrant (and) undocumented community Robles said. We want to emphasize the importance of being educated and knowing your rights. Students spoke out against ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in California; while telling audience members about rights they should remember if they come in contact with immigration enforcement officers. In addition; many spoke out against the possibility of removing Las Positas Colleges Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) designation and grant. Students; like Portilla; stressed the importance of titles and programs such as HSI. This is an unfortunate conversation that should not be happening; because if we lose that title; we lose a major source of federal funding; Portilla stated in her speech. That impacts all students here; not just the undocumented ones. Other students shared personal stories about immigration. Camacho said that as the daughter of immigrants; she was compelled to speak to represent everyone that cant represent themselves out of fear. While the protest was organized by students and not affiliated with Las Positas College or the Chabot-Las Positas Community College District; several faculty members advised student leaders on where to walk; measures to stay safe and methods of promotion. They decided this is what they wanted to do and we advised them; English professor and Puente adviser Michelle Gonzales said. Im a product of the Chicano student walkouts; Gonzales stated. We wouldnt have programs like the Puente program without the student walkouts urging reforms in education for disenfranchised and minoritized student groups. The event concluded with students and faculty decorating posters to display around campus and handing out material with legal and mental health resources for the undocumented community. Linda McMahon was confirmed as the U.S. secretary of education by a 51-45 party line vote in the Senate this afternoon during a hearing punctuated by protests; according to NPR. McMahon formerly led the Small Business Administration and was CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment. She has been criticized for her lack of education experience; which consists of a year on the Connecticut State Board of Education; according to NPR. McMahon was nominated by President Donald Trump; who has said her job is to downsize and ultimately eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. The department began downsizing Friday by offering employees 25;000 to resign or retire; according to media reports. The secretary of education takes an oath of office vowing to faithfully discharge the duties of the office. Instead; Linda McMahon has vowed to dismantle the Department of Education; said Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Massachusetts) in a statement. By voting in favor of her confirmation; Republicans have signed off on her plan to make cuts that will hurt public school students; educators; families; and communities. Republican senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) praised McMahon; saying she could help improve declining academic outcomes. As part of reversing this downward trend; the federal government must comprehensively evaluate its strengths and weaknesses when it comes to administering education programs; Crapo said. Linda McMahon will bring this much-needed; outside-the-box thinking to the U.S. Department of Education; where she will also focus on key priorities such as defending Title IX and combating antisemitism on college campuses; he said. The US Department of Education (DOE) sent an email to employees Friday offering up to 25;000 to resign or retire; or take severance; whichever is less; the Guardian reported. Obtained by the Guardian; the email states this is a one-time offer in advance of a very significant Reduction In Force for the US Department of Education and gives employees until close of business Monday to accept. This move comes amid swirling reports that the White House may have been preparing an executive order to abolish the department entirely. According to a DOE employee; the email was sent; retracted; then sent back out. Some have noted that severance pay and compensation for unused leave would likely add up to more than the buyout offer. This is beyond manipulative and misleading; claimed the worker; who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation; the Guardian reported. Also; if you leave voluntarily; you are not eligible for unemployment. The agreement also includes a rule that the employee would have to pay back the buyout money if they are employed or contracted with the federal government again in the next five years. Under a reduction in force; you have more rights to re-employment and unemployment; an employee noted. In a marked break with tradition; President Trump is planning to sign an executive order that would make English the official language of the United States for the first time; according to White House officials; the Wall Street Journal reported. In its nearly 250-year history; the country has never had an official language stipulated at the federal level. Hundreds of languages are spoken here; reflective of the countrys long and storied history of welcoming immigrants from around the globe. The executive order would nullify a federal mandate issued by former President Bill Clinton that agencies and other recipients of federal funding should provide language assistance to non-English speakers; officials said. However; agencies will still be able to provide documents and services in other languages; according to a White House summary of the order viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The goal of making English the national language is to promote unity; establish efficiency and provide a pathway to civic engagement; officials said. Cracking down on illegal immigration and promising the largest mass deportation operation in American history are among the key tenets of the Trump presidency. During the campaign; the president warned that migrants who dont speak English were being dropped into communities such as Springfield; Ohio; raising concerns that students could not communicate in classrooms. We have languages coming into our country. We dont have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language; as Trump put it last year; the Wall Street Journal reported. These are languagesits the craziest thingthey have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. Its a very horrible thing. UCLA could be at risk of losing more than 1 billion if the Trump administration follows through on threats to withhold funding from colleges that continue any race-based programs; the universitys chief financial officer said Thursday. The campus receives about 900 million in direct federal funding for a range of contracts and grants and another 200 million for overhead; said Stephen Agostini; UCLAs chief financial officer; during a virtual town hall Thursday. UCLA held the town hall to discuss federal policy actions and their impacts on the campus. All of these funds are unfortunately at risk as the new administration considers how it wishes to pursue with its own budget making and its own initiatives; Agostini said. Agostini added that if UCLA is currently looking for other opportunities in the event those dollars are withdrawn; but acknowledged that there are not really funding options out there to replace that level of funding. Theres really no way to sugarcoat it; he said. Earlier this month; the U.S. Department of Education warned colleges in a dear colleague letter that they must get rid of any race-based initiatives; including programming like race-specific graduation ceremonies; dormitories and administrative supports. Like other University of California campuses; UCLA has a number of such programs and resources; including its Black Bruin Resource Center. The dear colleague letter; however; does not have the force of law; said Mitchell Chang; UCLAs vice provost of equity; diversity and inclusion. We continue as a university to take all of those things seriously; Chang said. But at the same time; we are confident that what were doing complies with existing laws. Peggy Carr; the federal official who supervises the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP); often called the nations report card; was placed on administrative leave by the Trump administration on Monday. The move comes on the heels of the elimination of millions of dollars of projects at the U.S. Department of Educations research arm; EdWeek reported. Former President Joe Biden appointed Carr; a career staffer at the National Center for Education Statistics for 30 years; to a six-year term as agency chief in 2021. The departments press office confirmed that Carr had been placed on leave; but did not respond to a request for comment. The National Center for Education Statistics collects and reports data on student achievement; the teacher workforce; and the ongoing condition of schools. Carrs suspension; which came with no explanation; has sparked concern among researchers and education leaders about disruption at the agency; which has been noted for its thorough and nonpartisan approach. NAEP data; such as the ongoing decline in reading scores; has often provided an anchor for research and analysis; said Thomas Dee; a professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Education; who called Carrs suspension outrageous. That data allows people to have different opinions; but not necessarily different facts; he said; EdWeek reported. California Teachers Association President David Goldberg said the union is committed to fighting the harmful directives issued by the U.S. Department of Education to eliminate diversity; equity; and inclusion (DEI) programs. In a letter on Friday; the department said school districts; universities; and colleges; must eliminate DEI programs or risk losing federal funds. President Trump continues to hurt our students and communities with divisive directives; Goldberg said in a statement to EdSource. Lets be clear about what this latest directive is. It is an attempt to take money from our students; when we should be investing more. The letter only gives school districts two weeks to dismantle DEI efforts; and many advocates are concerned that districts will comply out of fear of losing funds that help marginalized student groups. The Trump administration has failed to fully fund public education and to address important issues for parents and families; such as keeping students safe in schools; providing adequate resources for their public schools; and fixing the educator shortage and pay issues; Goldberg said. Speaking to thousands of his agencys employees this week; U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles; polio and other dangerous diseases; AP reported. Nothing is going to be off limits; Kennedy said; adding that pesticides; food additives; microplastics; antidepressants and the electromagnetic waves emitted by cellphones and microwaves also would be studied; AP reported. The Make America Healthy Again commission; made up of cabinet members and other administration officials; will develop a strategy around childrens health. Kennedy said it will investigate issues; including childhood vaccinations; that were formally taboo or insufficiently scrutinized. While Kennedy did not directly call for changes to the vaccination schedule; his plan to investigate it raises questions about his commitment to Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy; a Louisiana physician who harbored grave misgivings over Kennedys anti-vaccine advocacy. Cassidy ultimately voted to send Kennedys nomination to the Senate floor after he said Kennedy assured him that he would not alter the federal vaccine schedule. Cuts to funding to the National Institutes of Health could hamper funding the University of California system receives for research on various diseases; including cancer; Alzheimers; Parkinsons; diabetes and heart disease; the Los Angeles Times reported. Friday; the National Institutes of Health said it would cut indirect funding by more than half. Beginning Monday; indirect funding from the institute was capped at 15 of grants  down from 57 given to UCLA and 64 provided to UC San Francisco. These time-honored university partnerships have led to some of the most powerful and impactful research discoveries in human history; a statement from the UC read. Life-saving treatments for cancer; diabetes; heart attacks; and strokes; including in children; and new technologies and industries that translate into hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs are all at risk. America is first in research; but its dominance is not assured. Hundreds of high school students walked out of class in Los Angeles; Fresno and other cities on Monday and Tuesday to protest President Donald Trumps immigration policies. Some school districts reported large drops in attendance Monday; when immigration rights advocates announced a Day Without Immigrants to protest Trumps plans for mass deportation. Los Angeles Unified reported 34 of students were absent Monday; compared with the average of 7. Fresno Unified reported 30 of students absent; compared with the usual 8; according to the Fresno Bee. Students again walked out of at least 10 Los Angeles schools Tuesday to join protests; according to the Los Angeles Times. District officials urged students to attend class and make their voices heard in other ways; preferably on campus. Trump has vowed to carry out the largest mass deportation in history. Some 2 million undocumented immigrants are estimated to live in California. About 1 in 10 students in California schools have at least one undocumented parent. The Trump administration has been temporarily blocked from freezing federal assistance for education; disaster relief; health care and law enforcement; as a U.S. district judge in Rhode Island judge announced a temporary restraining order. The order comes amid a federal lawsuit involving California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 22 other state attorneys general. California Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and the California Department of Education; meanwhile; issued a statement and sent a letter to all California local educational agencies. I encourage all educators to remain focused on accelerating the achievement of our students. Together; we have reduced chronic absenteeism for all student groups; and we have begun to close persistent achievement gaps; especially for our socioeconomically disadvantaged students. We must build upon these efforts to make sure that all our young people are able to learn; grow; and thrive; he said in a statement issued Monday morning. Now is not the time to be distracted by external efforts to demean and divide. Please continue to stay the course with local programs that are producing results. Now is the time when our students need consistency; support; and community more than ever. After the U.S. Department of Education rolled back federal Title IX protections on Friday for students based on gender identity; Californias state superintendent of public instruction assured students; families and educators that state law wont be impacted. Last year; the Biden administration extended Title IX protections so students who are discriminated against based on gender identity would be protected. On Friday; Craig Trainor; acting assistant secretary for civil rights; issued a letter saying that would be revoked and the Trump administration would revert to 2020 Title IX rules. In a statement; State Superintendent Tony Thurmond said California schools will continue extending protections against discrimination to all students based on gender; gender expression; gender identity and sexual orientation. In California; all still means all; Thurmond said. While the Trump Education Department announced that they will no longer protect all students from discrimination; California law is unaffected by recent changes to federal policy; and continues to provide safeguards against discrimination and harassment based on gender; gender expression; gender identity; and sexual orientation. While federal guidance devolves; our commitment to safeguarding the rights of all students persists. Title IX is part of the Education Amendments of 1972 and prohibits schools that receive federal funds from discriminating against students based on gender. However; interpretation and enforcement of the law changes depending on who holds the White House. Shortly before news broke Wednesday morning that the White House had rescinded a memo freezing federal aid  which had sown confusion in higher education a day earlier  leaders of the California State University system discussed how they might adapt if anticipated cuts take effect. CSU officials said campuses should look for opportunities in the midst of shifting federal funding priorities and are also pursuing support from businesses and philanthropies to bridge any interruption to federal dollars. As CSU leaders concluded their discussion; CNN and other news organizations reported that the White House Office of Management and Budget had rescinded the memo freezing federal aid. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X that other executive orders impacting federal funding remain in effect. One such order seeks to end diversity; equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal government as well as under federal grants and contracts. Ganesh Raman; CSUs assistant vice chancellor for research; said CSU must ensure that this phase of panic doesnt cause paralysis; where our faculties stop preparing proposals for future opportunities. Raman added that there is uncertainty about which federal aid could be removed and; in particular; which grants could be deemed related to diversity; equity and inclusion. California State University estimates that more than 511 million in research expenditures during the 2022-23 school year were funded by federal agencies; accounting for 63 of research expenditures that year. The funding included 161 million from the Department of Health and Human Services and 114 million from the Department of Education; with the remainder coming from the National Science Foundation; Department of Agriculture; Department of Defense and other federal agencies. Roughly 83 of CSU bachelors degree recipients in the 2022-23 school year  more than 88;000 students  participated in a research; scholarly; creative or other experiential learning activity while in school; according to the university system. A recent CSU report highlights examples of the ways federal funding supports research and other projects on its 23 campuses; including projects that involve students. At Cal Poly Humboldt; a series of grants and contracts totaling 23 million from the U.S. Department of Energy funds a project to improve the electrical energy system reaching rural tribes in Humboldt County. San José State University received about 10.7 million from the U.S. Department of Education for a program that works to improve low-income students readiness to attend college with academic support and other services. And California State University; Los Angeles received roughly 7.5 million; also from the federal department of education; to recruit teachers; place them in high-need schools and allow them to earn their teaching credentials. The White House budget office reversed course on an order to freeze federal funds to programs that could have impacted homeless; veterans; seniors; disaster victims and school children nationwide today. The White House decision came after a day of confusion and anxiety as states tried to determine which programs would have funding stopped and which ones would not. A federal judge in Washington D.C. temporarily halted the order Tuesday evening; saying courts needed more time to determine its ramifications. The White House Office of Management and Budget memo rescinding the order; shared on the Democracy Forward website; contained little information except to tell all department heads to direct questions to their general counsel. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear a case that could pave the way for religious charter schools. The court will decide if a religious school operated by the Catholic church can open in Oklahoma as a charter receiving public money. The court is expected to hear the case in late April and to decide it by early summer; according to The Associated Press. If the conservative majority court approves federal funding for the religious charter; it could dramatically change the nations balance between church and state; according to The 74. It could also further erode enrollment in and funding for traditional public schools. We cannot allow public schools to become Sunday schools; said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten in a statement. Parents and families support their neighborhood public schools  including charter schools  because they are dedicated to helping all kids learn and thrive. By taking public money and placing it in private hands; this case threatens not only public schools that are secular; open and accessible to all; but also religious liberty and freedom. The Trump administration has disbanded a newly formed board meant to advise federal agencies about school safety strategies and practices to protect students; Education Week reported. Organized in June; the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse External Advisory Board included school safety experts; parents of children killed in school shootings; school district leaders and advocacy groups; EdWeek reported. The board held its first meeting in October and was in the process of establishing its priorities. Three board members confirmed to EdWeek that they received a Department of Homeland Security memo notifying them of the plan to terminate the current board members as future committee activities will be focused solely on advancing our critical mission to protect the homeland. What is more critical infrastructure than our schools? said Tony Montalto; whose daughter Gina died with 16 other students and teachers in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland; Florida; per EdWeek. Trumps first administration created the board after the Parkland school shooting; and the board was codified into law as part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act; but the Department of Homeland Security provided little clarity on the boards future; according to EdWeek. President Trump worked with the families of the victims in the first administration; said Montalto; who told EdWeek that he hopes to rejoin the board if it is reassembled. We are very hopeful that we continue that working relationship. To us; this is a nonpartisan issue. Weve been able to work with great champions on both sides of the aisle. Penny Schwinn; Tennessees former education commissioner; is Donald Trumps choice for U.S. deputy secretary of education. He has named Linda McMahon as his pick for secretary of education. Schwinn; a long-time educator; has ties to the Sacramento area. She founded Capitol Collegiate Academy; a Sacramento charter school; and served on the Sacramento County Board of Education; according to CBS News Sacramento. She most recently worked at the University of Florida. Before taking the top education job in Tennessee; Schwinn worked in senior positions in the Delaware education department and the Texas education agency; according to Education Week. Schwinn started her career in education as a Teach for America teacher in Baltimore. Schwinn was credited with implementing successful comprehensive literacy policies in Tennessee during the pandemic. During her tenure she faced criticism from both Democrats and Republican leaders over issues such as teaching American history to her support of charter schools; according to The 74. Rural school districts across California and the rest of the country may lose a longtime federal funding source meant to compensate rural counties because of the large areas of untaxable forest land in their regions. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act; which has been approved almost continuously since 1908; was eliminated from the federal budget by Republican lawmakers last month; according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat. Last year; California counties received nearly 40 million in funding due to the law. The act was started as a way to compensate communities for the loss of property tax when the federal government created the U.S. National Forest Service and set aside millions of acres of land for logging. House Speaker Mike Johnson did not put the bill forward for a vote last month and it died in the House. The bills sponsors plan to reintroduce it before the final budget deadline in March; according to the article.,28-Feb-2025

But could is the key word. So; we will stay on top of whats happening and it will inform our coverage as it affects California. How are federal decisions affecting students; educators; and families here? Will school funding or instruction shift? How are California policymakers adjusting to the new landscape? As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. California officials are giving students an extra month to meet the state financial aid priority deadline; saying fewer high school seniors have finished paperwork so far this year due to delays in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and uncertainty about federal education policy and immigration enforcement. The California Student Aid Commission; whose executive director approved the 30-day extension from March 3 to April 2; reported a 25 drop in the number of California high school seniors who have completed financial aid applications this year compared with the same point in 2023. The April 2 state priority deadline is the date by which students planning to attend a four-year institution must file applications for most state aid programs; including the Cal Grant. Students seeking Cal Grants to attend a community college can apply through Sept. 2. Students have until June 30; 2026; to complete the application for federal awards like Pell Grants. The decline in completed applications is due in part to a two-month delay to the start of the federal 2025-26 financial aid application cycle; commission officials said. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or FAFSA; opened on Dec. 1 following the troubled rollout of the 2024-25 FAFSA. The form is typically available to students on Oct. 1. People who work directly with students also say that concerns about the administration of President Donald Trump are giving some families pause about whether to file for federal student aid this year. The decision is especially fraught for students with undocumented family members in light of Trump administration rhetoric promising an unprecedented crackdown on unauthorized immigration. Federal law bars the use of data submitted through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or FAFSA; for any use other than determining financial aid; but both the National College Attainment Network and the California Student Aid Commission have cautioned mixed-status families that the federal form may not protect their data going forward. The California commission has recommended that families fearful of federal immigration enforcement complete the California Dream Act Application; or CADAA; a state financial aid program that does not share information with the federal government. Some of the parents are saying; If they take me; they take me. But my kid is going to apply for financial aid for college; said Jasmin Pivaral; senior director of college culture at the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools; an organization that works with five high schools in Los Angeles Unified. Its been really sad and really challenging to hear that parents are having to make this difficult decision; and we have no sense right now what kind of mental toll this is taking on students. The Trump administration has also threatened to shut down the U.S. Department of Education and pursued other efforts to freeze federal funding. Linda Doughty; the director of the San Diego and Imperial Counties Cal-SOAP Consortium; which works to boost college participation; said some families have mistakenly concluded that federal student aid will not be available next school year as a result. Our parents thought they canceled financial aid; said Doughty; whose group is helping to organize several free financial aid workshops at area schools this weekend. Thats misinformation. Doughty and her Cal-SOAP colleagues are among the organizations around the state working with the commission to host Cash for College workshops where students and their families can get advice from financial aid experts to file the FAFSA or CADAA. As of Thursday morning; there were 140 such workshops scheduled virtually as well as in person in cities including Bakersfield; Norwalk and San Bernardino.

Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles County remains open a year after the states corrections oversight board deemed it unsuitable for the confinement of minors and four months after it ordered the center to shut down due to ongoing noncompliance with the states minimum standards for juvenile facilities. The problems plaguing the facility; located in the southeast LA city of Downey; include insufficient probation officers; students arriving to class late; abysmal performance on standardized education testing; and the centers heavy reliance on substitute teachers. A court hearing that had been scheduled for Friday was to decide the halls fate; but L.A. County Superior Court Judge Miguel Espinoza deferred the decision until April; to allow for the completion of a re-inspection by the Bureau of State and Community Corrections; known as BSCC; the state agency that deemed it unsuitable after multiple inspections. Advocates say they are concerned that the situation could impact the quality of education the youth are receiving. When we are thinking about young folks who are in these camps and halls; we want to make sure theyre having access to academic rigor that is deeper than just a packet; that theyre actually being challenged; and that they have the opportunity that when they leave these sites; to either return to their school of origin and be ready for the next thing  for trades; for college; for these things that allow them to be productive members of our community and society; said Yasmine-Imani McMorrin; director of education equity at Childrens Defense Fund California. While the issues found at Los Padrinos appear to be improving according to reports from an ongoing inspection; advocates are skeptical because such moments of compliance in the past were short-lived. We have a history of these independent bodies identifying issues with the education being provided; and then it might improve for a little bit; but then; once eyes are off or the settlement ends; we see those issues persist and get even worse; said Vivian Wong; an education attorney and interim director of the Youth Justice Education Clinic at the Loyola Law Cchool; whose recent clients have included Los Padrinos students. This chaotic history has led to the formation of groups like the Education Justice Coalition; which started in 2020 to advocate for the release of as many youth as possible at the height of the pandemic and high-quality education for detained youth. Advocates like Wong insist that while conditions must improve inside the juvenile facilities; the priority should be to release youth back into their communities. Our policy recommendation; and something weve been consistently advocating for; is keeping people in the community as much as possible; Wong said of the education coalition. If you dont have the staff; we should really question why young people are in here. In less than two years since its reopening; Los Padrinos has been plagued with accusations and findings of violence; allegedly incited by probation staff; and about the inadequacy of its programs; including the residents access to education. This site was to provide relief after two other juvenile halls; Central Juvenile Hall in Sylmar and the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Boyle Heights; were shuttered and deemed unsuitable given their ongoing problems. Issues included insufficient staffing; lack of proper training on the use-of-force policy; as well as youth being confined to their rooms for too long. Los Padrinos itself was closed in 2019 amid allegations of abuse; with six officers charged with assault and child abuse the year of its closure; and a history of concerns about safety for both youth and probation officers. Then- California Attorney General Xavier Becerra; the county; and the county office of education entered into settlements in 2021 after problems were revealed with access to education for the youth. A 2010 settlement in a class action lawsuit showed inadequate education programs for the youth in the countys largest juvenile detention facility. Reforms focused on 13 major areas; including literacy; instruction; transition; special education; and after care. Over 230 youth are at Los Padrinos and; as of Jan. 6; 190 of them were attending the halls court school; which is operated by the countys office of education. They are all pre-disposition youth who are awaiting court action or transfer to another facility. The student population consists of 167 male students across 21 living units in the hall and 23 female students across two units. Students ages can range from 13 to 22 years old in grade levels from sixth to 12th. Some youth remain at Los Padrinos for months; up to a couple of years; but the average stay is about 22 days. A typical day at Los Padrinos is supposed to go as follows: School is scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m.; and students remain for two class periods until 11:50 a.m. Then they return to their units for lunch for the next hour and a half; after which they return to class until 3 p.m. for their third and final period of the day. The only shortened day is Friday; which ends at 1 p.m. for teacher professional development. Probation staff are tasked both with taking students from their units to their classroom and remaining in the classroom while class is in session. But the BSCCs inspection from December 2024 noted that inspections have found an inability of facility staff to get youth to school on time due to lack of staff available for supervision within the classroom. The issue seems to have subsided at least once in the last year and a half. During an annual inspection in June last year; both the county office of education and youth reported that students had not been late to class in months due to low staffing. That inspection was conducted by the countys Probation Oversight Commission; a group created by the county Board of Supervisors in 2020 to monitor and advise the Probation Department and the Board of Supervisors as they implement justice system reforms. But that appears to be one of the few inspections since Los Padrinos reopened that found that students arrived at class on time. On-time arrival to class  of both students and teachers  has been listed as a problem during inspections more often than not. It is unclear how many instructional minutes students have missed due to low staffing; but the 2024 California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress showed that not a single 11th grader at Los Padrinos met the state standard for math; and just over 2 met the English standard. Students enrolled in LA Countys juvenile court schools take additional assessments referred to as STAR Reading and Star Math; which measure achievement and growth in the two subject areas. Assessment results for the fall of 2023 showed that 0 of students tested proficient in reading and less than 5 tested proficient in math. In the most recent STAR assessments from winter 2024-25; urgent intervention was needed for nearly half of all students in reading and about 44 in math. Just about 10 of students met or surpassed the benchmark for reading; 11.5 in math. The remainder were either bordering on needing intervention; or they needed it already; in both subjects. While the numbers indicate progress; they remain low for the students grade levels. At Los Padrinos; there are currently no reading specialists on staff; according to Erin Simon; associate superintendent at the countys office of education. Reading intervention is provided by students teachers. Many students arrive with very low reading levels; she said; and the county education office has implemented intervention programs such as Read180 to increase reading levels. Theyre adjusting to their environment; theres mental health and trauma; said Simon; who was hired nearly 11 months ago to provide oversight over the countys juvenile facilities; with an emphasis on Los Padrinos. The complexity of it is knowing that many of those students only stay with us for a very short period of time; so we are always pushing to have more intervention and more instruction; but we also know that there are certain things that happen when a student gets here. She added that more counselors are available now to help Los Padrinos students address mental health concerns; first addressing social-emotional learning and mental health challenges and then moving into academic intervention programming. On a typical day; students might be taught by their assigned and credentialed teacher; but it is not uncommon for a substitute to lead the class instead. While Los Padrinos; the countys largest juvenile hall; has 33 permanent; credentialed teachers  up from 26 in October 2023  they rely on nine to 14 substitute teachers on a daily basis; according to Simon. There are also seven vacancies at this time. It does require a teacher who is really not afraid to work in those camps and halls; a teacher who can really build relationships with many of our students; knowing they have trauma and also some mental health issues; and so it does become a very difficult position to fill; especially at Los Padrinos; Simon said. On the day of last years inspection by the countys probation oversight commission; there were seven full-time teachers on the job and 16 substitute teachers. Its a huge problem; especially for this population; where they have adults come in and out of their lives; and; frequently; there is already so much instability in their education. Theyre coming and going in and out of schools; transferring school districts; said Wong about the reliance on substitutes. If the teacher is not there; then they have to build up that trust again with the new person. It can be especially difficult for a student who requires accommodation in the classroom; as is the case with Wongs clients. She said a client; currently at a county juvenile camp; was doing well in school after having developed a relationship with a teacher. But when the teacher was out for a month; the student could no longer access his curriculum in a similar fashion; because every teacher implements accommodations differently. As the debate continues over whether Los Padrinos will close or remain open; in part depending on the result of the latest BSCC inspection that began last week; advocates are pushing to maintain the focus on the youth inside the hall. Were dealing with fires and fire recovery; climate change; housing; homelessness; all these things that overlap with our young folks and their needs; McMorrin said. But its such a priority to get it right; because there is no do-over for these critical years of youth and to do what we can to prepare them for this world.

But could is the key word. So; we will stay on top of whats happening and it will inform our coverage as it affects California. How are federal decisions affecting students; educators; and families here? Will school funding or instruction shift? How are California policymakers adjusting to the new landscape? As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. Vicky Martinez feels cheated that her children havent had much exposure to the arts at their Los Angeles Unified (LAUSD) schools despite state funding through Proposition 28; the states landmark arts education mandate. She believes access to the arts could help them cope with their anxiety and ADHD; conditions that have spiked post-pandemic. I had more arts than my kids do; said Martinez; mother of three LAUSD students in the Highland Park area. Thats not right. It makes me angry that our kids are being denied the arts when theres been so much research about how it keeps kids engaged in school. We should be making progress; and instead we are lagging behind. Many parents share her outrage. The families of eight students; including Martinezs three sons; 12; 15 and 17; and the author of the arts proposition have joined forces to file a lawsuit against Los Angeles Unified School District; the nations second-largest school district; and its superintendent; Alberto Carvalho. The lawsuit; filed Monday afternoon in Los Angeles County Superior Court; alleges misuse of funds as well as misleading the public in its rollout of Proposition 28 that sets aside roughly 1 billion a year statewide for arts education. LAUSD has willfully and knowingly violated the law; said former LAUSD Superintendent Austin Beutner; who authored the proposition; and as a consequence; is harming hundreds of thousands of students by depriving them of the arts education that they are entitled to under law. The suit also claims that LAUSDs mismanagement of Proposition 28 funds; particularly at low-income schools ; has disproportionately impacted Black and Latino students; deepening inequity. The thrust of the law; says Beutner; is that all students; not just privileged ones; deserve access to the arts. We have not received notice; nor have we been served with any lawsuit regarding Prop 28; an LAUSD spokesperson said in a statement to EdSource. That said; we have sought to clarify any misunderstandings regarding Prop 28; and we continue to follow implementation guidance as provided by the state of California to ensure that we are fully complying with the requirements of Prop 28. The suit is the latest push for accountability on arts education funding. Beutner and a group of major unions; including UTLA; the local teachers union; SEIU Local 99 and Teamsters 572; wrote a letter to education officials last year demanding the state hold districts responsible for their spending. LAUSD was allotted roughly 77 million for arts education in the 2023-24 school year. The unions are helping pay for the lawsuit; which comes at a time when the district is already facing mounting scrutiny over its handling of three large cyberattacks exposing sensitive student information and the appropriateness of its response to recent catastrophic fires. LAUSD has done exactly what the law prohibits; the suit argues; it has eliminated existing funding sources for existing art teachers; and replaced those funds with Proposition 28 funds; thereby violating the requirement that the funds supplement rather than supplant existing sources. Moreover; LAUSD has made no meaningful effort to recruit or hire new art teachers as required by the law. Given extensive research that arts education has key academic and social benefits; the law was designed to hire new arts teachers; and most schools are required to spend at least 80 of funds on staff. The plaintiffs allege that the district has been willfully misinterpreting the law and misleading families and teachers. Bottom line; theres been rampant misuse of the funds; Beutner said; and the guidance and oversight has been insufficient. In an Aug. 15; 2024; memo to the board; Carvalho acknowledged spending new Proposition 28 money to pay for existing staff; which is not allowed. Given historic staffing challenges in filling Arts educator roles and because 80 of Prop 28 must be spent on labor; the District prioritized the use of Prop 28 funds to cover existing staff as well as hire new staff. The district argues that the law only requires an increase in arts funding for the district as a whole. The law requires that non-Prop. 28 arts expenditures at the district level are higher than previous years and does not factor in differences in spending at a school site level; according to an LAUSD fact sheet. Beutner has long objected to this interpretation. The law requires that every school to increase its arts offerings; he maintains; so that all students have access. Cecily Myart-Cruz; the president of UTLA; the union representing about 35;000 LAUSD educators; claims the district has not been honest about its use of Prop 28 funds. The superintendent pulling out a bulletin saying; Oops; my bad; doesnt work; Myart-Cruz said. If you have arts in school; you will change lives.  And so; Im exasperated by the districts lack of response and responsibility to providing arts educators for our babies and the communities in which we serve. To be sure; similar issues have arisen across the state. Facing budget woes; some schools have used creative bookkeeping maneuvers to pay existing staff with the new funds; instead of actually adding arts teachers; experts warn. The temptation to redirect these funds can arise when schools face financial pressures in other areas; said Allison Gamlen; visual and performing arts coordinator for the San Mateo County Office of Education. This is a clear violation of the intent of the proposition and; unfortunately; not an isolated incident. However; many other districts across the state; from Pacifica to Long Beach; have successfully used the proposition funds to build robust new arts ed programs; experts note. That disparity explains why many parents and teachers have been calling for greater transparency in how schools use the arts money; which landed in schools in February 2024. We want real support for the hiring of folks who can provide arts instruction; and I think that this is the righteous thing. This is the legal thing; said Nicolle Fefferman; a veteran LAUSD teacher; who also co-founded the Parents Supporting Teachers advocacy group. Who does this money serve sitting in a district bank account? Families want a seat at the table. At many schools; there was no conversation about Prop. 28; said Martinez. Parents had no input. Make no mistake; the impact of any misspent funds on families can be severe. Martinez said that her 15-year-old son; going by the alias Julian in the suit; suffers from severe anxiety and feelings of despair; conditions she believes could be alleviated by the therapeutic influence of the arts. When her oldest son got his hands on a guitar; she says; he started to thrive. Arts improves learning; especially for low-income students; said Martinez. We are hurting them by not providing it. Another plaintiffs mother; going by the alias April T.; says her son; going by Lucas; 9; only gets one hour a week of art class; the same as before Proposition 28. She says she pays for private music classes because none are available through LAUSD. Accountability is among the most critical issues facing the Proposition 28 rollout; according to a recent report by Arts for LA; a key arts advocacy organization. Teachers; parents and students should know whether; how; and when Prop 28 decisions are being made; said Lindsey Kunisaki; who wrote the report. Theyll be the ones to directly experience the impact of those Prop 28 decisions in practice; and moreover; theyre the experts in the realities of their own classrooms and communities. Carvalhos August memo also acknowledges that the district did not consult with school communities specifically about Prop 28 Arts funding; but will encourage principals to solicit feedback going forward. Many experts recommend an independent oversight committee of administrators; teachers; families and community partners to make sure that arts education funds are properly spent. Some may assume that county offices of education provide oversight; but that is not within their purview; experts say. Arts education advocates have long urged the California Department of Education (CDE); which is administering the new funding; to step up enforcement of the rules. Many have complained that the department has not provided enough guidance to schools already struggling with myriad post-pandemic issues. The structure of the proposition did not include any provision to ensure adequate CDE staffing to address questions and the overall confusion that has been a common thread; said Allison Cagley; executive director of Friends of Sacramento Arts; an advocacy group. There was no one or two people at CDE that could adequately address the questions. CDE officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Amid the controversy; many parents are anxious to see Proposition 28 funds put to good use to spark engagement at a time of chronic absenteeism and widespread disaffection at schools. This is an investment in our kids; Martinez said. Our kids deserve this. We all agreed on this. The state of California voted for this. So why arent we doing it?

In her home country of Guatemala; Maribel attended a one-room schoolhouse for two years; but the teacher was often absent; causing class to be canceled. She never learned how to read. The school closed during Covid; and she never returned to class until last year; when she moved to Oakland. Now 11 and enrolled in middle school; she is learning English and at the same time filling gaps in her education  how to read; interpret graphs and acquire other skills she never learned before. Maribels school; Urban Promise Academy; is one of four middle and high schools in Oakland trying out a new curriculum developed just for students who did not attend school for years in their home countries. School staff asked EdSource to only use middle names to identify students because they are recent immigrants. There is heightened fear among immigrant students and families because of the Trump administrations promises to ramp up immigration enforcement. In Maribels classroom; though; no fear was palpable. Instead; there was joy. On one recent morning in her English class; Maribel and her peers were analyzing graphs showing favorite colors; favorite foods; favorite sports and home languages among students in a class. They were practicing marking the x-axis and y-axis; pronouncing numbers in English and talking about what the graphs meant. How many students like pizza? asked teacher Shannon Darcey. Eight students like pizza; responded a student. About 3;300 students in Oakland Unified this school year  close to 10 of the total student population  immigrated from other countries in the last three years. Of those; at least 600 had more than two years in which they did not attend school in their home countries. These students are often referred to as students with interrupted formal education; or SIFE. The reasons students missed school vary. Some lived in rural communities far from schools; for example. For others; it was dangerous to attend school because of gang violence or war in their communities. Other students simply had to work. When students havent yet mastered academic reading; writing; or math in their home language; they have a lot more to learn in order to grasp middle or high-school level material; even as they are learning English. But if the materials or curriculum are designed for younger students; it can be boring or seem too childish for teenagers. Before this school year; Darcey taught English to recent immigrant students with a huge range of academic knowledge. Some students were reading at seventh or eighth grade level in Spanish; for example; while others could not read at all. She remembers some students being frustrated. I had one kid  Every single day for six months; he was like; I cant read. Why are you giving me this? Darcey said. He felt like; Everyone else in here knows what is happening; and I have no idea what this is. Why are you telling me to have a book in my hands? For years; Darcey tried to access curriculum designed especially for students who have had big gaps in schooling. She had heard about a curriculum called Bridges; developed by researchers at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York. But when she tried to get materials from them; she was told they were only available for teachers in New York. Julie Kessler; director of newcomer and English language learner programs in Oakland Unified; said many teachers she has worked with in Oakland Unified and San Francisco Unified were frustrated at not being able to access the Bridges curriculum. And so its like; whos got a bootleg copy of it? Kessler said. And its just been inaccessible to the field. She said she has often seen students with big gaps in schooling disengaged in class. They are experiencing sometimes an alternate assignment; sometimes sitting with like a Disney book or a childrens book; when even the scaffolded newcomer curriculum is inaccessible to them; Kessler said. We were seeing a lot of that because teachers didnt have a way to connect them to what was happening. Last year; though; Kessler was able to secure funding from the California Department of Social Services California Newcomer Education and Well-Being program; to develop a new curriculum considering the needs of Oaklands newcomer population and aligned to the California English Language Development standards. She worked with some of the authors of the Bridges curriculum; who now have an organization called the SIFE Equity Project. The resulting Curriculum for SIFE Equity is open source; available to all teachers anywhere on the internet. And Kessler said there are teachers in San Rafael; Elk Grove; San Diego and Vista using it; in addition to Oakland. Outside of California; the curriculum is also being used in New York City and Prince William County; Virginia. Were hearing a lot of gratitude from teachers who are like; Oh my God; finally something that I can use with this group of students that feels worthy of their time; that feels respectful of them and feels like its doing the skill building that we know that they need; Kessler said. The curriculum currently includes about 50 days of instruction  less than a third of a school year. Kessler said the district is now trying to get more funding from the Department of Social Services to develop a full 180 days; so it can be used for a full school year. Darcey said the curriculum has made a huge difference. She now has separate English classes just for students who have gaps in their education. The class began the school year with a unit on identity. Studens learned how to say their names; how old they are; where they are from; what language they speak. They later put together identity maps with their name in the middle; and information about their hometowns; their ages; their responsibilities; families and what they like to eat and do for fun written in spokes all around. Then they created slideshows with the information and added photos. Fourteen-year-old Anallelys map shows that she likes salad; fish and marimba music; that she speaks the indigenous language Mam in addition to Spanish; and her hometown is in the mountains and forest of Guatemala; where it is hot and rainy. Anallely only attended school in her hometown until third grade. After that; she stopped going so she could work with her father; planting and harvesting coffee on a farm. She said she had never learned about graphs or maps to organize information before coming to school in Oakland. Its very useful; because you can use them to define how many people like something or which is their favorite; or where they are from; she said in Spanish. She hopes to someday become a doctor to help babies and people who are sick. Shed also like to travel the world. Most of Darceys students are new to reading in any language; so Darcey also works with them in small groups to teach them letter sounds; and how to sound out syllables and one-syllable words like tap; nap and sat; using a curriculum called UFLI Foundations; adapted for recent immigrant students by teachers at Oakland International High School. Another student; Arturo; never attended school in his life until he enrolled at Urban Promise Academy at 14 years old. In previous years; a kid like that in my class; I wouldve felt like; Oh my God; theyre like totally lost; and it feels like theyre just sitting there 80 of the time; Darcey said. But she doesnt feel that way about Arturo. He is engaged; hes trying. Can he read the words on the page yet? No. But hes still able to follow whats happening. Darcey is grateful to work with these students. They bring such an eagerness and excitement; a willingness to try new things that maybe other kids their age are not as enthusiastic about; Darcey said. They often bring a work ethic that I think can really help a lot of them be successful in school. Giving these students skills to navigate the world is important; Darcey said; because they are already part of our society. Were going to prepare them to be successful in their lives; she said. Maribel; the student who only attended two years of school in Guatemala; said she was afraid to come to school in the U.S. at first; but now she looks forward to it. The teacher speaks some Spanish and she always helps us if we need anything; Maribel said. I can write some words in English now; and Im writing more in Spanish; too. And Im learning to read.

State leaders spent much of Tuesday trying to determine the potential impact of a White House freeze on federal grants and loans that could potentially affect millions of California students and their families. A White House memo released Monday from the Office of Management and Budget called for the freeze to begin Tuesday at 2 p.m. PST. But; just minutes before 2 p.m.; U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan in Washington; D.C.; blocked the order until next Monday at 2 p.m. PST to give courts more time to consider its impact; according to Politico. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Tuesday that the freeze could cut 3 trillion in federal funding from programs that help the homeless; veterans; seniors; disaster victims and school children nationwide. The order has thrown state programs into chaos and created uncertainty around their administration; said a media release from Bontas office. I will not stand by while the president attempts to disrupt vital programs that feed our kids; provide medical care to our families; and support housing and education in our communities; Bonta said in a statement. Instead of learning from the defeats of his first administration; President Trump is once again plowing ahead with a damaging  and most importantly; unlawful agenda. Bonta joined 22 other state attorneys general to file a lawsuit calling for a temporary halt to implementation of the memo. The White House directive called for advancing the Trump administrations policies and called the use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity; transgenderism and green new deal social engineering policies a waste of taxpayer dollars. California Gov. Gavin Newsoms office called the White House memo a violation of federal law. We are confident funding will be restored; officials there said in an email to EdSource. California Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said the White House action is misguided. (It) serves nothing more than to hurt the most vulnerable students and people in our nation; he said. Early Tuesday; state education leaders expressed concern that student loans; special education; Head Start; and Title 1 programs could be impacted by the freeze. But by late Tuesday afternoon; conflicting information from the White Houses Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Department of Education made it unclear which programs would be affected; according to a letter from the California Department of Education to county and district superintendents scheduled to be sent Tuesday night. According to the letter; the U.S. Department of Education assured state departments of education that Title 1 programs for low-income schools; special education and other formula grants will not be frozen. But; officials at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said these programs will be subject to the same scrutiny as others regarding compliance with the Trump administrations executive orders. We hope to gain more clarity on affected programs before Feb. 3 and plan to communicate this information to the field as soon as possible in case the OMB directive becomes effective; said the California Department of Education guidance signed by David Schapira; chief deputy superintendent. Officials in the U.S. Department of Education said only discretionary grants would be affected and not formula grants; according to Troy Flint; spokesperson for the California School Boards Association. A list of discretionary grants on the U.S. Department of Education website includes grants for educator development; charter school programs; early learning programs; school and community improvement programs; as well as grants for arts and literacy education. California School Boards Association officials will be watching to see how the issue is resolved in the courts; Flint said. This is a fluid and fast-moving topic; and we dont think we have heard the end of it. University leaders are also waiting to see what the freeze could mean for them. University of California staff and lawyers are working diligently to clarify the potential impacts on the university; said President Michael Drake in a statement. He noted that the White House has said federal student loans and Pell Grants would not be impacted. We are in contact with key policymakers in Congress and at federal agencies; as well as association partners and other higher education institutions. We are evaluating what actions we are able to take and will keep you informed; Drake added in a message to the UC community.

Such a significant change without an overwhelming consensus should result in a pause or minimally a non-mandatory elective. The lack of State funding is at least a Yellow flag and the recent Presidential DEI Ban Executive Order is a Red flag; potentially no money or worse lawsuits with the Federal government and money spent on lawyers and not on students. Another example of poor governance is the lack of a California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET) for Ethnic studies. Mathematics; Science; and Languages ranging from Arabic to Vietnamese as well as many other subjects have a CSET to help assure teachers have mastery of the subject matter. As noted in the State of Californias ethnic studies handbook: Before embarking on lesson planning for an ethnic studies course; it is important that ethnic studies educators are aware of how their own identities; implicit biases; and cultural awareness may impact ethnic studies teaching and learning. What credentialing controls are in place to assure this important awareness? The biggest failure of the PAUSD is not sharing with the public the specific content and grading schemes envisioned for their Ethnic Studies course.,27-Jan-2025

But could is the key word. So; we will stay on top of whats happening and it will inform our coverage as it affects California. How are federal decisions affecting students; educators; and families here? Will school funding or instruction shift? How are California policymakers adjusting to the new landscape? As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. West Contra Costa Unified School District students Jorge Espinoza Jr. and Luke Wilson have a seat and voice at a table that most students dont have regular access to. For the last five months; theyve been sitting next to school board trustees at the dais; asking top administrators accountability questions and making recommendations on what could improve student experiences in the classroom. On top of that; they are the first two students in the district to be paid for this work. It definitely has been an experience; Espinoza said. Its been a journey  one that I would never want to change. I believe Ive learned so much; not only just being a board member; especially as a student; but also getting to engage with my community; engaging with the cabinet and what they do and seeing and learning all these things that go on within the board. Although many districts in California have student board member positions; its rare for them to be paid; said Troy Flint; spokesperson for the California School Boards Association. This school year; West Contra Costa Unified became one of the few in the state that pays its student board members. School districts; including West Contra Costa; moved to pay board members after the 2023 passage of Assembly Bill 275; a state law that allows districts to pay or offer course credits to student board members. The West Contra Costa school board passed the resolution last July and updated and reapproved it last month to comply with the law. Flint said that the concept of involving student board members more fully; including compensating them in some very rare cases; is gaining momentum  (and) breaks from traditional practices where student board members were not supported to the same degree weve seen become more common with this recent generation. Historically; its been difficult to recruit students to be student board members; said West Contra Costa board member Demetrio Gonzalez-Hoy. Various West Contra Costa Unified school board members had said publicly that they believed including compensation and course credits would motivate a more diverse population of students to apply. They pointed to the time commitment the students must make. Typically; board meetings start at 6:30 p.m. and last between three and five hours  time that students could use to work for pay; study or participate in an internship. Its a commitment; and many students in our high schools have to not just take care of their own family; but they have to work; Gonzalez-Hoy said. Having to do a volunteer position for our students is a big ask. In West Contra Costa; at least one of the two student board members must be from a school with 60 of students receiving free or reduced lunch; which was an effort to ensure representation from schools in less affluent areas of the district; Gonzalez-Hoy said. Students are paid 150 for every board meeting they attend and 100 for each agenda review meeting and board study session. Students also receive elective course credits. There are typically two board meetings and an agenda review meeting per month; Gonzalez-Hoy said. The number of study sessions varies based on the business of the district. They wont have to choose between a paycheck and being in this (student board member) position; but also they wont have to choose between their studies and working; Gonzalez-Hoy said. Espinoza and Wilson just wrapped up their one-semester term; and the new student board members will be announced and sworn in at the Feb. 12 board meeting. Wilson; who attends El Cerrito High School; is also a student board member of the Contra Costa County Office of Education; a term that lasts the whole school year. He suggested West Contra Costa should do the same. I believe that having two student board members elected for one whole year would actually be a better benefit for all students because of that momentum not being lost; Wilson said. One semester really doesnt make sense in terms of that momentum and actually picking up a grasp on how the meetings run. But then youre out when you get that grasp. Gonzalez-Hoy said the board is considering all student feedback to make the student board member experience as beneficial as possible. Last year; San Diego and Palm Springs school districts passed resolutions similar to West Contra Costas. San Diego students receive elective course credit and are paid 1;736 per month; the amount paid to other board members in the district. Student board members in Palm Springs are paid about 296 monthly; according to the Palm Springs Desert Sun. Paying student trustees is not very popular; especially now with many school districts dealing with declines in enrollment; school closures and budget cuts; resulting in a lack of available funds. Most board members serving on school boards around the state are paid low wages. The amount of money board members receive in California depends on the average daily attendance in the district. Average daily attendance  which is different from overall student enrollment  is calculated by taking the total number of student attendance days and dividing by the number of school days in the year. In a district like West Contra Costa; where average daily attendance was about 23;400 in the 2023-24 school year; regular board members make up to 400 a month. Board members in districts with 25;000 to 60;000 students receive up to 750 monthly. In districts with 1;000 to 10;000 students; board members receive up to 240 monthly. In the smaller districts with 1;000 or fewer students but more than 150; trustees receive up to 120 a month. Those in districts with less than 150 students only make up to 60 a month. Theres a stark difference in pay for board members in larger districts with more than 250;000 students. According to the state education code; compensation in those districts is set by municipalities. For example; board members in the Los Angeles Unified School District; serving more than 500;000 students; receive 125;000 annually if they dont have another job and 50;000 if they do. Some states; like Idaho; Montana and Wyoming; do not allow compensation for board members; and the elected board members are volunteers. Espinoza and Wilsons top priority this year is to create a student bill of rights that will eventually be posted in every classroom. The reason for this is to empower students to not only know their rights but to also have respect and accountability; not just within students but all of our staff as well; said Espinoza; who attends Middle College High School. Incoming student board members will take over the process of finalizing the bill of rights through outreach and surveys. Another change Espinoza and Wilson spearheaded was to include the All Student Congress  a group of middle and high students; nominated by their schools  in discussions about the Local Control Accountability Plan; a document that outlines how the district should be spending money. Student feedback will then go to an advisory committee made up of parents and community members. Students need to be part of the All Student Congress to qualify for the student board member position. The student congress also elects both student board members. Espinoza Jr. and Wilson also helped draft Educational Response to the Climate Emergency; a resolution to help implement climate literacy in West Contra Costa schools and to help students graduate with a deeper understanding of the impacts of climate change and possible solutions. The resolution could include a climate literacy curriculum and professional development for educators. Other goals Espinoza and Wilson have that will be passed on to the incoming student trustees are to implement a Student Advisory Panel; have more student trustee engagement; and have career technical education programs for students in grades K-8. Wilsons advice to would-be student board members is to go into it with an open mind in terms of when youre listening to the adults and frequently  youll hear debates; youll hear people not agreeing with each other. And before you just immediately pick a side; try and hear both sides. Espinoza said future student board members shouldnt be shy or let the complex jargon and policies hinder them from applying. Youre there for a reason; Espinoza said. These adults; theyre here to serve us; and as students; were here to represent the students voices directly as well. With two new board members and an interim superintendent stepping into their roles; dynamics could change; but avoiding a budget deficit and finding a new leader remain top priorities. Following the retirement of Superintendent Chris Hurst; the district faces an uncertain future as it grapples with budget problems; declining enrollment and how best to serve a largely low-income student population.

But could is the key word. So; we will stay on top of whats happening and it will inform our coverage as it affects California. How are federal decisions affecting students; educators; and families here? Will school funding or instruction shift? How are California policymakers adjusting to the new landscape? As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. Speaking more than one language is a superpower and a growing necessity in our global economy. If we want more California students to experience the economic; academic; social and emotional benefits of multilingualism; bilingual or dual language classrooms should be the gold standard for all schools. English learners; who often fall behind in school; especially stand to benefit from bilingualdual language programs. Families across the state  regardless of political affiliation; or whether they speak English at home  can recognize the academic; cognitive and economic advantages of bilingualism. They want multilingual education for their children when they see the data and experience these benefits for themselves. While California has made major strides toward making bilingual classrooms the norm; there is a long road ahead; particularly in communities with large numbers of English learners. This is a grave injustice for the 40 of California children who speak a language other than English at home; because these children would excel in bilingual classrooms academically while still developing literacy in their home language and English. We need long-term investment from the state for our students to realize their full potential. A recent report from the UCLA Civil Rights Project underscores this urgent need. Proposition 227; which passed in 1998; mandated English-only education for English learner students in public schools and dismantled bilingual teacher preparation programs. Then; in 2016; California voters passed Proposition 58 with 73 of the vote; overturning Proposition 227 and making it easier; in theory; to implement bilingual classrooms. However; more than two decades of English-only education has left us without enough qualified bilingual teachers; even though there is now more demand for them. According to the UCLA report; out of 1.1 million English learners in California; only 188;381 students; or 16 of that population; were enrolled in these programs as of the 20192020 school year. California is still a nationwide leader in supporting bilingual education; despite these numbers. The states English Learner Roadmap and Global California 2030 show that our education leaders really do want to improve our students critical thinking skills; family and community relationships; and earning potential through bilingual education. And one-time programs like the Bilingual Teacher Professional Development Program; English Learner Roadmap Power in Collaboration Across California; and the English Learner Roadmap Implementation for Systemic Excellence are doing important work to fulfill these goals. But visionary policies and initiatives; along with one-time grants alone; are not enough. Schools and districts require sustained resources and incentives to train bilingual teachers; set up classrooms; purchase materials; recruit families and ensure their programs can launch and thrive. Right now; we simply do not have that in California. Its a symptom of our states fundamental lack of investment in education overall  California is the worlds fifth largest economy; but we rank 18th in education funding out of the 50 states. To illustrate this; the UCLA report compares California to Texas; another state with similar English learner populations. Even though California has a large number of English learner students and high interest in bilingual education; its still difficult to expand these models in California classrooms. Meanwhile; in Texas; enrollment in bilingual education programs is twice as high as in California. This is because Texas mandates bilingual education for districts enrolling significant numbers of English learners and provides extra state funding per student enrolled in these programs. This ensures strong demand for bilingual teachers and secure funding for their training. Districts and schools need ongoing funding sources like this embedded in their funding formula. Policymakers must support both one-time initiatives like those mentioned above and long-term sustainable funding sources that help increase our bilingual teacher pipeline and incentivize schools to build high quality bilingualdual language programs. These long-term solutions could be modeled after initiatives like First Five; which has received 492 million in state investments since 2000. We need a comprehensive approach to the bilingual teacher pipeline; such as giving colleges and universities Jump Start funds to hire faculty and build out their bilingual teacher prep and authorization programs. California should also create initiatives to recruit and give incentives to students who graduate from high school with a State Seal of Biliteracy to enter bilingual teacher preparation programs. Language is the vehicle of learning. When educators understand how to integrate and leverage language development across everything; all students thrive. We must invest in bilingual education long-term if we are ever going to create a sustainable future for our states most valuable resource: our children.

Ronald Reagan; as governor; opposed mandatory busing as a tool of school desegregation and; as president; attempted to undo affirmative action policies in the workplace. How could it be; Nicol wondered; that he appointed the first Black woman to sit on the California State University board of trustees? And what did Hampton do once she got there? Black Woman on Board: Claudia Hampton; the California State University; and the Fight to Save Affirmative Action; Nicols recent book; answers those questions and others about Hamptons two-decade stint on the board of trustees that governs the 23-campus public university system. Prior to her appointment at CSU; Hampton worked to enforce desegregation orders in the Los Angeles Unified School District and earned a doctoral degree from the University of Southern California. She rose to the CSU board when an opportunity to meet then-Gov. Reagans education secretary turned into an informal vetting process for a board seat. (She met Reagan only once; as far as Nicol can tell; an encounter Hampton described as pleasant.) The book tracks Hamptons emergence as a master tactician and a skillful diplomat on the Cal State board of trustees. Initially excluded from the informal telephone calls and meetings in which fellow board members discussed CSU business outside of regular meeting times; Nicol writes; Hampton traded votes with trustees to earn influence. Eventually; she began hosting board members for dinner to ensure she had a voice in important decisions; a practice she continued as board chair. Hampton also withstood subtle (and not so subtle) racism to win support for policies benefiting low-income students of color. Though at first skeptical of Hamptons approach to board politics; Nicol came to understand her as a pragmatist who worked within the periods racial and gender norms to wield power on a board dominated by white; wealthy and conservative men. I realized how genius she was; Nicol said. When she became board chair; she had a strategy of letting her supporters talk first; and then her opponents had to play defense later. Everything was strategic. Nicol also details Hamptons work to implement; monitor and ensure funding for affirmative action programs. Soon after Hamptons death; California voters passed Proposition 209; a 1996 ballot measure that bans state entities from using race; ethnicity or sex as criteria in such areas as public education and employment. But Hamptons legacy is still felt in CSU and beyond; Nicol writes. CSU created the State University Grant program after Hampton argued that increases to student fees should be offset by more need-based aid. A student scholarship named in her honor is aimed at underserved Los Angeles-area students. The California Academy of Mathematics and Sciences; a prestigious public high school that was her brainchild; continues to operate on the campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills. Nicol counts herself among the many students to have benefited from Claudia Hamptons advocacy. She attended an enrichment program for African American high school students at Cal State Dominguez Hills and received a State University Grant to pursue her masters degree at Cal State Long Beach. Today; Nicol is the associate dean of personnel and curriculum at Long Beachs College of Liberal Arts. She spoke to EdSource about the book and Hamptons legacy. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. You write about a couple of incidents in which Hampton used some savvy diplomatic skills while on the Cal State board of trustees. Would you mind walking us through an example or two of those strategies?She was silent (at board meetings) for her first year. She didnt talk; because she used that time to assess who were the power players; who were the people who had the capital. And so when she identified them; she said; I have to trade votes with them. One of her first appointments was to be on the Organization and Rules Committee. People treated it as a throwaway committee; but she was the chair; and so she decided; Im going to learn all of the board policies inside and out. Before she passed away in (1994); she asked for a very specific rule; which is to hold presidents accountable for the implementation of affirmative action. What she wanted to ensure was that someone besides the middle manager; who would be the affirmative action officer; would be held accountable to make sure that they didnt fall short on their affirmative action goals. Claudia Hampton faced both subtle and overt racism that challenged the legitimacy of her role on the board. What are some examples of the discrimination that she experienced and how she was able to overcome that opposition?She was kind of presumed incompetent; because she was a Black woman coming into the board  even though she actually had a doctorate degree coming in. You had a trustee by the name of Wendell Witter. This is a few years in. Theyre discussing affirmative action. And he yells out; Oh my God; theres a n in the woodpile. So she is taken aback by all of this; and all the men on the board; she says; are upset; too. And Wendell Witter is looking around like; Well; what did I do? Its just an expression. Hampton had a lot of experience in administration in (Los Angeles Unified); and she worked explicitly on race relations within the K-12 setting. When she got to the board; instead of yelling at Witter for what he had said; she told the board chair at the time; Ill talk to him individually. You keep going with that meeting. And so the men on the board started to rally around her; because they viewed her as a political moderate; because she had every right at that moment to tell him off for the statements. Help me to understand the victories that Hampton ultimately won with regard to affirmative action and related policies.California Gov. Jerry Brown was actually kind of an opponent of affirmative action. He would say he supported it; but then when it came to funding; he would support (Educational Opportunity Programs; or EOPs; which help low-income and other underrepresented students attending a CSU campus); but he would not (fund) student affirmative action (in admissions) or faculty and staff affirmative action (in hiring). Hampton put a lot of pressure on Jerry Brown. She would call him out in meetings and say; What about your commitment to these principles? (Hampton ultimately used her board position to ensure funding for student affirmative action pilot programs during a period of budget cuts in the late 1970s.) There was an update in the admission standards for students (in the 1980s). And she told people; Yes; were going to increase the admission standards; but what were going to do is make sure that theres enough EOP money that would prepare students in low-income areas in order to make sure they could meet those standards. She was particularly focused on the fact that L.A. Unified and San Francisco Unified had these large numbers of students of color and low-income students; but they werent getting access to things beyond reading; writing and arithmetic. They didnt have access to a drama club or all those sorts of things. So she made sure that the CSU put funding aside to help support (that programming). Hampton and other affirmative action advocates success was short-lived because of the passage of Proposition 209; which prohibited state and local governments from considering race and other factors in public education. What were the forces that brought about Proposition 209?You have the recession that happened in the 1990s. Wherever theres a recession and an economic downturn; you see an uptick in either racial violence or racial animus. So thats one big part of it. The other part is the L.A. riots of 1992 because folks are like; Well; they dont deserve affirmative action; because look at how theyre behaving in the streets. Thats the idea. And then you also have; in 1994; Proposition 187; which has to deal with undocumented students. So you take all of those things  the recession; the LA riots; Proposition 187. Then; on top of that; you have (University of California regent member Ward Connerly; who championed Proposition 209) as this Black man who becomes a public face of the anti-affirmative action movement. (Connerly has said he has Native American; Black and white ancestry.) Hes kind of supercharging the debate over whether affirmative action is a good thing or not. So thats really what led to its falling apart. We find ourselves now in a moment when a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision has effectively ended the practice of race-conscious college admissions. Are there lessons from Hamptons life that you feel are even more relevant today in that context?I think that having diversity in our boards is really important because diversity leads to better policy. Too often we think of diversity as a feel-good thing  to make people feel included and inclusive. We talk about representation; but representation is more than just having two or three people from this group here; Its really about having different perspectives so that you can write better policy. If you look at the CSU board; it is more diverse than it was; but is it reflective of whats happening on the ground with students? Im at CSU Long Beach; and we have a much larger Latinx population than what is represented on the board. I always say that the American project has been built on racism; and we dont reconcile that. And Hampton just approaches the problem in a different way than others. I was raised in the Black radical tradition. So I had to come to terms with this pragmatic side  that we need the pragmatic and we need the radical at the same time. You need the radical to raise the consciousness of people; but you need the pragmatic in order to turn it into policy and something that has a legacy. I also think that Hampton  her story; her life; what she did for the board really demonstrates; in a lot of ways; peoples ignorance about how the trustees work. Theyre super powerful; but they are super unnoticed. They are appointed by governors; and they are not held to account by the public.

Here are 10 of our favorite podcast episodes from 2024. Take a listen: In the 1974 case Lau v. Nichols; the U.S. Supreme Court decided that schools must take steps to make sure students who do not speak fluent English can understand what is being taught in their classrooms; whether through additional instruction in English as a second language or bilingual education. Heres the story of how this case began and how it changed education; from the perspective of a teacher: A growing body of research shows that having a Black teacher increases students scores on math and reading tests and increases the chance that they will graduate from college. California has been trying to recruit and retain Black teachers for years; but theyre still under-represented. Hear from a Black teacher about whats keeping her peers from getting to and staying in the classroom: Almost one-third of adults in California can do little more than fill out a basic form or read a very simple piece of writing in English. Many of them are immigrants. Experts say programs aimed at addressing poor literacy reach only a fraction of adults who need help. One way to reach them is to bring classes directly to the workplace. This episode highlights the story of one janitor: As a wave of protests on university campuses called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for universities to divest from companies with military ties to Israel; student journalists emerged as crucial sources of information. Increasingly; student journalists are doing this work under the threat of arrest and violence. When teachers noticed that children in Oakland preschool and kindergarten classrooms were not engaging in imaginative play or interacting with each other as much after the pandemic; staff at Childrens Fairyland; a local theme park; turned to an old favorite  puppets. The West Contra Costa Unified School District promised back in 2019 that Stege Elementary School would get a complete redesign and remodel; to attract more students and more experienced teachers and turn around low test scores; high suspension rates and chronic absenteeism. But now; a group of teachers; staff and parents are suing the district; alleging that it failed to address severely poor building conditions and teacher vacancies. What happened? This year; state lawmakers passed a bill to require public schools to restrict student cellphone use. A parent shares how shes seen cellphones affect student interaction and increase bullying; and what she thinks about the efforts to restrict them: Rigoberto Sánchez-Mejía has been taking music lessons with Harmony Project; a nonprofit music education organization in Los Angeles; for 12 years; since he was 5 years old. He credits them with putting him on a path to college and giving him a tool to calm down when life is too stressful. Oakland Unified School District began this school year with some unsettling news: The drinking water in the districts schools had dangerously high levels of lead. But lead testing hasnt been required in California schools for the last five years. That means Oakland Unified is unusual among California school districts in that it knows that theres a lead problem at all. This November; 16- and 17-year-olds in two California cities; Berkeley and Oakland; were able to vote in school board elections. A high school junior reflects on the significance of this moment and the importance of civic engagement for teenagers: We are committed to keeping you informed with the latest  always free; always independent.

But could is the key word. So; we will stay on top of whats happening and it will inform our coverage as it affects California. How are federal decisions affecting students; educators; and families here? Will school funding or instruction shift? How are California policymakers adjusting to the new landscape? As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. Any parent or teacher who has worked with a seriously ill child knows how difficult it is to meet the childs educational; physical and emotional needs all at once. Melanie Brady; a lecturer at USCs Rossier School of Education; suggests that parents and teachers can improve the lives and schooling of sick students in Los Angeles as long as they realize the uniqueness of each child and understand that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to balancing both a students health and their education during formative K-12 years. Students with chronic conditions or who are going through difficult periods of treatment often dont have the best options to pursue their education. But here are some steps Brady suggests both parents and teachers can take. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. What kinds of options are there on a traditional school campus to support students who are sick? It varies depending on the (grade level); ability and performance and needs. So; I think that if a parent finds themselves in a situation; they want to plan ahead and contact the teacher  and also plan ahead and ask the doctors or the nurses for resources. You want to talk to the school and see whats available. Sometimes; people who have long-term health conditions already will have a 504 plan in place; or an IEP (individualized education program). When those are not in place and something takes somebody by surprise; thats where the process needs to be initiated. What kinds of options are there if a student cant pursue their education on a traditional campus? If a person; the parent; needs more support for their student; see if (the school or district has) a liaison. Sometimes; the hospitals will also have a liaison; usually in the form of a nurse or social worker. If its a larger hospital; they will have a schoolroom. They will have some teachers. They will have a process to try to help collaborate with the home studies. There are (also) home school options that sometimes the schools will collaborate with for independent study; especially with teenagers. Thats a helpful thing. There are also California Virtual Academies. And they are set up with the whole academic public education thats similar to the L.A. schools and the public schools throughout the state. There are several different options to take a look at; but working within the current setting is probably the best place to start for any parent or student; especially when the difficulties or the challenges that are upcoming are new. What types of pedagogy are most effective in working with students who are enduring chronic medical conditions? One of the things is actually really simple; and I actually found it on the California Department of Education website; and they have articulated just a basic goal thats kind of broad but important: working with that individual child and what they can do and trying to help them not to lose ground. But then you have these different dynamics that require flexibility; because if the condition changes; if theyre in the hospital; theres timing of treatment. Theyre not going to be able to be in a room or have bedside teaching when certain things are going on. Some people may not be able to leave their bed. Thats where bedside teaching is going to be helpful; and also to engage with students (in) conversation; because the longer theyre in the hospital; the more prone they are to depression. There (are also) things to do to ameliorate that for those students; to try to bring them together. They have different educational needs; especially in that environment. And you cant do teaching like you can all at once in a K-12 classroom. How do educational approaches vary across age groups when it comes to working with sick students? When were looking at the younger children; we really want to make sure they have significant playtime. Playtime is so important to the development of their minds and their brains. Theres a lot of learning that goes on there. Theres stress relief that goes on there. Part of it is to be aware of what the typical development is; but also where a child is; because I think that theyre already in a distressing social- emotional space. So; moving forward from where they are is whats important  and not comparing them to others. I dont think we have to look so far to see that once they get to double digits (in age); with some of the social media platforms; how negatively impacted they can be because of those comparisons. It really needs to be a building-them-up kind of thing; because when a student feels like they have at least one area where they can do well; and one thing to be self-confident about in terms of their skill sets; I think that goes a long way to helping somebody feel like they have something thats of value out in the world. A kid might be really good at chess. Somebody might be good at math; not good at language. Somebody might be good at art; but maybe struggles with some of the other subjects. (Finding) something that people are good at; and helping them be good at that thing; can go a long way for helping them with their identity development and forming of themselves. How can dealing with ongoing treatment affect students mental health? Not only do you want to try to maintain the current level of education and help with the focus on school as a recovery; (but students also) fall behind with friendships. Theyre not in their usual environment. Theyre removed from things they knew before. They have lost autonomy. And then; there can also be; because of these spaces; the accelerating of maturity; so theres these individual thought responses in terms of behavior within these spaces. The other problems that can happen in this space is with the emotional struggles; the social-emotional difficulties that can impede your working memory. It can make it difficult to focus. A person may or may not have learning difficulties or learning disabilities; but it certainly could highlight or accentuate some of those struggles and make it a little bit difficult. And; the thing that we want to try to help them with is to prevent that risk of not engaging with school because of their absence. We want to help support that so that theres as little fallout as possible for them as they hopefully are adjusting back to home life and some real normalcy and in getting back into being present in a physical school environment. What are the most important things educators and schools need to understand about working with students who are dealing with serious medical conditions? I dont think theres an environment today where anybody (working with these students) feels like theyre underworked. I think we all feel a little bit stressed and stretched out very thin. And; I think there are a lot of accountability measures that we try to use to make sure that were doing our due diligence; but I think sometimes they can fall short. Lets say theres a situation that needs some attention; theres some support thats being asked for. These students who have any of these needs hear no so often. There are so many nos; there are so many struggles. Its quite a weight of discouragement. In that space; anytime I can say yes; because theyve been told no so often; I want to be able to say; Yeah; we can take a look at modifying that assignment. Yes; we can take a look at what might help the students out in terms of social-emotional support. Modifying assignments for students becomes very cumbersome. But if we could just realize the enormous impact that we have every day on everybody and take that extra minute or that extra situation and say yes and help somebody; that can be really powerful.

Crisanto  a single mother of two elementary school-aged boys  is receiving about 800 a month in state subsidies for child care expenses; a part of a push to bolster the ranks of women and other underrepresented people into such male-dominated jobs as plumbers; electricians; carpenters and welders. She is now in her first year of an apprenticeship program run by an ironworkers union local in connection with Cerritos College; a community college near Los Angeles. It makes a huge difference. Its a lifesaver; Crisanto; 36; of Los Angeles; said of the subsidy. The money is particularly helpful because the very early work hours at construction sites make it hard to find and otherwise afford child care at schools and regular centers; she and others explain. Under the apprenticeship with Ironworkers Local 433; she begins working at 6:30 a.m. installing window and elevator structures at the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art under construction south of downtown Los Angeles. The child care subsidy is part of a wider campaign spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom to expand apprenticeship opportunities in many different fields for Californians usually not pursuing college degrees. The goal is to enroll a half-million Californians in state-supported apprenticeship programs by 2029  a huge increase from the approximately 84;000 in 2018 when Newsom announced the effort. The related child care funding comes from the Equal Representation in Construction Apprenticeship Grant (ERICA); for which the state has appropriated a total of 15.6 million over two years. A participant in pre-apprenticeships  readiness programs that often get them up to speed in math and general work skills  can receive up to 5;000 a year for child care. Those; like Cristano; in the next step; the actual paid on-the-job apprenticeships; can get up to 10;0000 annually. Officials and labor experts say the child care money represents a new strategy after past efforts to diversify the trades by gender showed little progress. The program is supposed to help women; non-binary and underserved communities interested in a rewarding career in the building and construction industry; according to the state Division of Apprenticeship Standards. (Men are eligible as well; but they are not the prime target.) The child care grants became available last year from the state budget and are distributed via labor unions; nonprofit organizations and colleges chosen in a competition. Another nearly 9 million is earmarked for campaigns to recruit more women; to run career fairs and to offer workplace training. The goal is to turn those women; many of whom barely made ends meet in the past; into skilled construction professionals earning close to 100;000 a year. Although the aid seems to be encouraging more women to enroll as apprentices; officials say it is too early to determine whether the program will significantly boost the number who persist through the four years or so the paid trainings can require. Some 37 women are among the nearly 1;200 apprentices in Cerritos Colleges ironworkers program run with the union; according to Graciela Vasquez; the schools dean of continuing education. But that is about 40 higher than before the child care money and the accompanying push to attract more women into the trades; she said. In the past; female participation in state-authorized apprenticeships across California could hardly have been smaller. Women comprise only about 10 of the nearly 95;100 current job training apprenticeships that are formally recognized by the state and receive some state money across many industries; according to the Division of Apprenticeship Standards. Even worse; just 3 or 4 of apprentices in building trades such as carpentry; plumbing; ironworking and electrical are women. However; women are strongly represented in a few apprenticeships; mainly in health care; child care and culinary services. With the child care grants and other funds for recruitment and training; enrollment of women apprentices in construction appears to be moving in the right direction; said Adele Burnes; deputy chief of the state apprenticeship standards agency. We hope to start to see higher percentages in one; two or three years from now. Finding and affording child care can be more difficult because of construction fields early work shifts and the need sometimes to work far from home. So the grant had to be a bit more flexible if we really want to help people in the trades; said Burnes. The subsidies can be used for private babysitters; even friends and family members; with proper proof of the work hours; as well as for day care centers and after-school care. Crisanto first earned a certificate in welding at a local adult school and was connected to the career apprenticeship; which includes some classes run by Cerritos College. She uses the child care grant to pay a relative who gets her children ready and takes them to school in the morning. That allows her to pursue a career path that is much more fulfilling and well paid than her past jobs. She and other women say they sometimes face doubts and harassment in a male-dominated industry. But she added; I love what I do. Thats what keeps me going; seeing I can keep up with the guys and keep learning. I am making something of myself. And this is my reward: my career. The subsidies may make a difference; said Felicia Hall; a workforce development manager for Tradeswomen; an organization that recruits women into construction careers and runs apprenticeship readiness programs across California. That is one thing we hear from all our mentees; even men. Child care is the No. 1 thing that hinders them from completing the program; she said. Among the substantial awards from the program; the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California is distributing 2 million for child care and has received another 1 million to recruit women; Cerritos College got 600;000 for child care and 300;000 for outreach and community building; the Fresno Area Workforce Investment Corp. got 1.4 million and 400;000. (The apprenticeships are usually run by councils of labor unions and industries; with the state looking over their shoulders.) In some locations; the overwhelming number of men in a trade has caused more men than women to receive the child care subsidy; officials report. Nevertheless; Jeremy Smith; of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California; said the funds are especially helpful to keep women on the job and make their work-life balance much easier. Still; with state revenues in decline; it is not certain whether the money will continue to be available after 2025. Women apprentices hope the program survives. Rocio Campos came to the U.S. from El Salvador at age 10 and now lives in Littlerock in northern Los Angeles County. Since she was a teenager; she held various jobs; including office work; sales; cashier; drafting and design. Sometimes; she took a second job on weekends to help pay bills. Tired of instability and low pay; she tried to enter a nursing program at a community college but wound up on a waiting list because it was overcrowded. Instead; she took a welding class and enjoyed that. That led to an apprenticeship with Ironworkers Local 433 and jobs assembling solar energy panels and windmills. A divorced mother; she was able to get between 800 and 1;200 monthly in ERICA child care funds that she uses to pay her mother to take care of her two sons; ages 11 and 17; while she is on the job; sometimes out of state. Previously; she paid her mother out of her own wages. The grant really helped me out a lot; Campos; 36; said. And she finds on-the-job satisfaction from assembling things from bottom to top. An ironwork apprentice; for example; usually starts earning about 24 an hour; and that goes up to 47 or so over four years by the time they graduate and become a journey person. Some work can be seasonal with unpaid breaks between projects; but overtime pay can be substantial as well. Dulce Martinez; 34; of San Jose; emigrated from Mexico at age 11 and; after high school; attended community college on and off. She held a series of jobs  from a house cleaner to a school health clerk  and became the mother of two boys; now 10 and 12. But several years ago; her husband; a construction worker and house painter; suffered an on-the-job injury that makes it difficult for him to work steadily. With the familys income strained; she began looking around for a better-paid career. Martinezs father and other relatives are ironworkers; but she never before thought of following in their footsteps. She then saw a Facebook page from the Silicon Valley-based social justice and training organization Working Partnerships USA; recruiting women into construction and technical jobs. She entered a pre-apprenticeship readiness program and used the ERICA funds for several months to pay a relative to watch her boys since her husband was not always available or well enough. Then in July; she landed her current apprenticeship as an instrumentation and controls technician at the Santa Clara Water District. She is learning to install and fix the water systems many meters and controls for pressure; chlorine and other factors. She is earning about 85;000 a year; compared with 35;000 at her old school job; and will be getting raises as the four-year apprenticeship proceeds. Another attraction is that work is less physically taxing than the electrical or plumbing jobs she first considered. It was something I couldnt pass up. Physically; Im going to be OK; and monetarily its going to be good for me and my family; she said. We are committed to keeping you informed with the latest  always free; always independent.

All of the elite programs are centered in the higher income; whiter areas. Entering magnet programs early can give students greater access to the strongest programs later. The stronger programs; in geographically convenient areas; that target lower income or minority students have comparatively weak curriculum. The strong dual enrollment or technical enrollment programs are again split in two . Id like to see the district make the gifted test opt-out and research and apply a points boost to the highly gifted test. Id also like to see additional middle and high school programs with high level and technical programs in all four geographic areas of Los Angeles that offer flexible method like through the IHP model. This would allow unidentified and identified talent in every area to access these programs. Previously these types of programs were equally accessible to students countywide which strengthened enrollment and attracted talent.,25-Nov-2024

It was nonbinding but allowed each student to see where (calc 1;2 3;4) they would be most successful andor identify areas to brush up on before starting the class. This is not punitive. Knowing what you dont know is very important so you can learn. This is not a game to level up. How do people think the rockets go up? How the booster was caught? How we will go to Mars?

But could is the key word. So; we will stay on top of whats happening and it will inform our coverage as it affects California. How are federal decisions affecting students; educators; and families here? Will school funding or instruction shift? How are California policymakers adjusting to the new landscape? As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. The University of California will increase annual tuition by 3;402 for out-of-state undergraduate students who enter the university next fall; under a plan approved Thursday by the systems board of regents. That will bring the total cost of tuition for nonresident students to 52;536. Tuition for incoming California residents will not be impacted by the policy; but those students still face separate; inflation-based increases that UC previously approved. Next years incoming class of Californians will pay about 500 more in tuition than the 2024-25 cohort; bringing the total to 14;934 before campus fees. The supplemental tuition charged to UCs nonresident undergraduates will go from 34;200 to 37;602  a 9.9 increase. The supplemental portion is on top of UCs base tuition charged to in-state students. The total 52;536 price for nonresidents will be frozen for that cohort of incoming students for up to six years. The hike; which was opposed by student leaders; was approved by the full board Thursday. It had cleared the regents finance and capital strategies committee on Wednesday. Nonresident students in fall 2023 made up 16.6 of UCs total undergraduate enrollment; or 38;701 students from other states and nations. More than half of those; just under 21;000; are international students. The share of out-of-state students varies greatly across the campuses; with Berkeley; Los Angeles and San Diego campuses enrolling the most. In recent years; however; those three campuses have started to reduce enrollment of nonresident students at the direction of state lawmakers; who have provided UC funding to replace spots for nonresidents with Californians at those campuses. The increase for now is a one-time hike; but UC could raise tuition further for future entering classes when it sets its budget for future years. Short of that; those future cohorts could also still be subject to inflation-based tuition increases; thanks to the plan UC previously approved for annual tuition hikes that apply to both resident and nonresident undergraduates. In defending the tuition raise; Nathan Brostrom; UCs chief financial officer; cited a challenging 2025-26 budget outlook for the university. As part of this years state budget agreement; UC was told to prepare for annual budget cuts of 7.95 beginning in 2025-26. So that was why the timing made sense; he said. UC officials also said UCs tuition for nonresident students is relatively low compared to peer institutions. At public universities in Virginia and Michigan; out-of-state students pay 7;000 and 11;500 more in nonresident fees than students at UC; according to UC officials. We were quite a bit behind. And so thats why we looked at whether we had some headroom to raise it; Brostrom said in an interview. Separately; a UC spokesperson said in a statement that the increase will support core operations amid anticipated state budget cuts without raising costs for current students and California residents. The cost of UCs supplemental nonresident tuition has steadily increased over the years. The regents approved a 762 hike in 2019; and the supplemental portion has been subject to further increases since the 2022-23 academic year as part of the annual tuition increases UC approved in 2021. But the increase approved Thursday represents by far the largest of those hikes. The approval of the tuition hike came over the objections of several students; including Eduardo Tapia; who is the university affairs chair for the UC Student Association. Opportunity to higher education should not face any more barriers; Tapia said during the Wednesdays public comment period. Instead of increasing the salaries of UC administrators; lets make sure college is more affordable for all. Francis Villanueva; an undergraduate student at UCLA; expressed concern that the tuition increase would impact the most underserved; underprivileged; and marginalized students across UC. UC claims that the UC system is already cheaper than other institutions across the nation; Villanueva added during Wednesdays public comment period. But in such a crucial time as this one where futures are on the line; how can the UC claim to care about students and making higher education affordable? Brostrom; the UC chief financial officer; said he appreciates the students passion about the policy; but added that UCs out-of-state students skew toward higher income brackets. Nonresident students arent eligible for Cal Grants; the financial aid awards available to California residents. Domestic out-of-state students can qualify for federal Pell Grants; but international students do not. We are committed to keeping you informed with the latest  always free; always independent.

Will there be big Brother style watchdog placed in the schools? Its the slippery slope of nonsense thats taking away what the kids actually need which is an academic education that will able them to; be productive and independent citizens. This is like when journalism and objectivity went down the drain in favor of entertainment and agenda. We stopped focusing on the facts to inform and started pushing a message and in order to have your message come through all the facts need to lie align with that which leads to falsifying negating facts. Were gonna do this in education now? falsify history and ignore facts that dont line up with the agenda? Whenever education is discussed either in the media or directly from the mountains of the politicians; they failed to actually include kids in the conversation. What is the outcome of all of this supposed to be? What exactly do we think were going to turn out of the school system? Does Trump in his cronies think that by dismantling the department of education and changing what is taught in schools theyre going to turn out little cookie cutter Republicans? What is the endgame? Adults always fail spectacularly when making assumptions about Whats best for kids as if its a one size fits all issue. and just by willing it or wishing it they can control the outcome of the individual. All these adults are ranting and raving about what kids are exposed to while exposing kids to hatred and fear. Do republicans really think that by removing certain books from the library you are going to be able to shape the way your children see the world or feel or understand things? Its utter nonsense. Most of the things that children see ; truly see; is witnessed in the adults around them. They are savvy and theyre paying attention and they understand a lot more than you think. Do you think if you impose one viewpoint on children that theyre not going to go home or go somewhere and look at the Internet and see the opposing viewpoint or the way things used to be and bring that knowledge into school and ask what the real truth is and whats gonna be the punishment for that? Are we just going to deny are we allowed to discuss? Can we bring that viewpoint into schools or the kids gonna get in trouble for bringing it up? Everyone is failing to play the tape all the way through till the end and seeing exactly how this is going to affect everything far far down the road.

Harper Jr. is scratching the word interim from his nameplate at California State University; Bakersfield. Harper; who has served as the universitys interim president since the end of 2023; was named CSUBs permanent president on Wednesday; the second day of a Cal State board of trustees meeting dominated by discussions about the financial pressures facing the university system. The system is projecting a 400 million to 800 million budget gap in 2025-26 as state leaders signal their intention to reduce funding for CSU. CSU Bakersfield has been able to prevent students from feeling the effects of a reduced budget; Harper said; buoyed by growing enrollment this school year. His focus is on making what he calls a pivot towards the community  expanding programs to boost the number of Kern County high school graduates and community college transfer students who enroll at CSUB. The Central Valley is growing rapidly but has lower college attainment than the rest of the state. Harper envisions the university taking a more active role alongside local K-12 schools to increase the number of students who meet A-G requirements; the coursework that makes students eligible to start college at a Cal State or University of California campus. Only 36 of Kern County high school graduates completed such coursework in the 2022-23 school year; according to state education data; compared with 52 of high school graduates statewide. Thats the real transition that the institution is making. It is to accept those problems as our own; Harper said. Were partnering with our K-12 providers and making sure that were doing absolutely everything we can to raise that statistic. Were not just going to sit back passively and watch our community go in a direction that we dont want it to go. One example of the work Harper hopes to get done: CSUBs teacher education program is forming a task force with the Kern County Superintendent of Schools Office and the Kern High School District in a bid to increase the number of students who are A-G qualified; he said. The campus is also experimenting with ways to get local students thinking about college even before they leave middle school. It recently started a pilot program with four middle schools and four high schools in which students as young as 12 will receive notices that they are guaranteed admission to CSUB so long as they meet A-G requirements. Weve seen that with young people; especially in under-resourced populations; their vision is truncated by their circumstance; Harper said. Whatever we can do; we have a responsibility to do; to extend that vision as far as it can go. The past decade has seen rising graduation rates at CSUB. Among first-time; full-time freshmen who entered Cal State Bakersfield in 2017; 49 graduated in six years; an almost 10 percentage-point increase from 2007. But the school has not caught up to some of its Cal State peers. Systemwide; the six-year graduation rate for the same group of students in the fall 2017 cohort was roughly 62. Harper said that the intervention that seems to have the most impact on improving graduation rates is pairing students with an academic adviser who works with them throughout their time at CSUB; guiding them through unforeseen challenges; like switching into a course that fits the students work schedule. As much as we can invest in that activity; the more positive outcomes that we (see); he said. The university is also experiencing some of the same longstanding graduation equity gaps that exist across California higher education. The six-year graduation rate among Black students who entered CSUB as freshmen in the fall 2017 cohort was 40; lagging Asian; Latino and white students. Harper has backed several CSUB initiatives to attract and retain Black students. Harper said that community college students at Bakersfield College who participate in the Umoja program; which includes courses on African American culture as well as mentorship and academic counseling; will find they can continue receiving similar support now that CSUB has its own Umoja program for transfers. The campus plans to open a Black Students Success Center in the spring and has already hired a group of faculty members whose work is focused on minoritized communities; Harper said. Harpers tenure as CSUBs permanent president begins at a moment when the California State University system is raising financial alarm bells. Cal State leaders are anticipating that a 164 million increase in revenue from tuition hikes will not be enough to alleviate other stresses on its budget. The system expects that state general fund revenue will drop nearly 400 million; according to a September budget presentation; and that 250 million in compact funding will be delayed. The university system also faces rising projected costs; including for basics it cant avoid like increased health care premiums and utilities expenses. Speaking at a Sep. 24 meeting; trustee Diego Arambula said the university system has almost been too effective at making these cuts year over year over year without explaining to legislators the impact those budget reductions are already having on students. We are doing everything we can to make them as far away from students; but a hiring freeze is a hiring freeze; and that does impact students if were not bringing someone into a role that we know is important; Arambula said. Its impacting our staff; who are taking on more to try and still meet the needs of the students who are here. CSUB officials last spring said they planned to cut the schools 2024-25 net operating budget by about 7; citing a decline in enrollment and increased salary and benefits costs. The school had less than a month of funding in its rainy day fund in 2022-23; slightly less than the net operating budget across the CSU system at that point. But Harper said enrollment this year is up between 4 and 5; driving tuition growth that is alleviating some budget pressure. The campus also has made temporary cuts to areas that arent student-facing; he said; such as professional development. Weve been able to really; really shield any negative effects on students; Harper said. Harper succeeds Lynnette Zelezny as president. He was previously Cal State Bakersfields provost and vice president for academic affairs. He will receive a salary of 429;981 and a 50;000 housing allowance. Harper was first hired at CSUB in 2016. Prior to his arrival at Cal State Bakersfield; he worked at West Chester University of Pennsylvania; Wilkes University of Pennsylvania and the State Council for Higher Education of Virginia. He holds a bachelors degree in communication from Pennsylvania State University; a masters degree in rhetoric from West Chester University and a doctorate in human communication from Howard University. He served eight years in the U.S. Army Reserve. We are committed to keeping you informed with the latest  always free; always independent.

The fact is; though the phone is an academic distraction; it is also a protection. Many schools are NOT safe and students need this safety feature to contact parents if needed; to video tape misconduct or abuse; or teachings in the class that are unethical. To remove this safety feature from students makes them more vulnerable in schools that are becoming increasingly unruly.,23-Sep-2024

About 1 in 8 college students in California is a parent. For these students; college isnt just about attending class and studying; its a daily juggling act that also includes managing households; raising children; and working to stay afloat. Moreover; the additional costs of child care; higher food expenses; and other necessities mean that student parents pay an additional 7;500 per child to attend college. Without significant financial aid; they would need to work at least 50 hours per week at minimum wage to cover these costs. The precarious balancing act is more than a personal challenge  its a consequential issue that spans generations and affects all Californians. When student parents thrive; the benefits ripple across communities and generations; creating economic stability for families; closing racial equity gaps; and strengthening Californias workforce and economy. Yet; their determination to balance work; study and parenting goes largely unnoticed because neither colleges nor the state systematically collects data on their demographics; experiences and outcomes. This Student Parent Month; we urge higher education leaders; policymakers and communities to change that. To empower bright futures for all Californians and bolster the states economy; which increasingly relies on a skilled workforce; California must transform the higher education system to address the needs of student parents and smooth the path to college for the 3.9 million Californians with children who have yet to complete their degrees. And it all starts with better data. Think of data both as a flashlight and a key. As a flashlight; data illuminates the needs and strengths of student parents; allowing colleges to identify the obstacles they face and the support they need to succeed. As a key; data unlocks a deeper understanding of who Californias student parents are; enabling more informed decision-making and resource allocation to improve outcomes for them and their families. Right now; California cannot effectively use student parent data in these ways. Only some campuses collect data on student parents and the several that do miss critical data points; such as the number and ages of students children; which would be helpful for assessing the need for child care and family-serving housing. Definitions of student parent vary between institutions; and within colleges; departments struggle to coordinate data collection efforts; further limiting their ability to leverage data to drive systemic change for student parents. Recognizing these gaps; our organizations launched The California Alliance for Student Parent Success and identified data collection and utilization as a critical component of our statewide policy agenda to support the postsecondary success and comprehensive well-being of student parents. To turn Californias student parent data into a flashlight and a key; it should be accessible; accurate and actionable: California has work to do; but progress is on the horizon; especially with the development of stronger data infrastructure through the California Cradle-to-Career Data system. Legislation to strengthen data collection for student parents is also underway. This year; our alliance cosponsored its first bill; the GAINS for Student Parents Act (AB 2458); which will require institutions to uniformly collect and report data on student parents and share this data with the Office of Cradle-to-Career Data. This will enable California to evaluate and shape policies and practices that will empower student parents to reach their full potential. The bill also seeks to make college more affordable; addressing financial hurdles student parents face. Now; all that remains is the governors signature to make this bill law. Addressing data gaps will enable California to better tailor resources and policies; streamlining student parents educational and career journeys and laying the foundation for a thriving economy. This Student Parent Month; lets honor their determination to work; study and parent by taking concrete steps to advance their success. Passing legislation like GAINS for Student Parents Act is one critical step. Its time for California to unite in uplifting the voices and future of student parents and; by extension; the future of California.

As we track these developments; we want to hear from you. What are you interested in reading about? What questions do you have? Your input will help inform our coverage. Californias 1.6 million high school students are starting another year; but without a critical school supply that I would argue is necessary for teens: condoms. Why should California public high schools be required to provide condoms to students? Because condom availability programs are an effective public health strategy supported by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help keep sexually active high school students safe. According to the CDC: This year; the Golden State has a golden opportunity to protect high school students in California from alarming statistics like these in the form of the YHES Act. The Youth Health Equity  Safety (YHES) Act (SB 954) would expand access to condoms by requiring public and charter high schools to make free condoms readily available to students; giving them the opportunity to protect themselves from STIs that negatively impact their well-being; shorten their lifespan and easily spread to the wider community. The organization I lead; the California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA); helps improve health access and equity by supporting schools and health care partners to bring health services to where the kids are  at school. The alliance is a proud co-sponsor of this bill because providing condoms in Californias high schools equips young people to make healthier decisions if they choose to be sexually active. Although some districts; such as Los Angeles Unified; San Francisco Unified and Oakland Unified; already offer condom access programs; the majority of schools in California do not. An online survey by TeenSource; an initiative of Essential Access Health; found that 68 of California teens lack access to condoms at their high school; and 98 agreed that easier access would increase condom use among sexually active teens. SB 954 would require all public and charter high schools to make internal and external condoms readily available to students for free beginning at the start of the 2025-26 school year. Condoms would need to be placed in a minimum of two locations on school grounds where they are easily accessible to students during school hours without requiring assistance or permission from school staff. Californias high school students have a right to consent to and access medically accurate; confidential; culturally relevant; and age-appropriate health services in schools. Our state has made great strides in reducing unintended pregnancy among adolescents in the past 20 years. Unfortunately; half of all reported cases of STIs in 2022 were among young people aged 15-24. The scope of the epidemic requires bold action. This year marks the second time state Sen. Caroline Menjivar; D-Van Nuys; has moved this sensible bill through the states Legislature. Menjivar has secured 5 million to cover the costs of distributing free condoms in public high schools for three years. The bill also specifies that if funds are not designated for this purpose; schools have no obligation to provide free condoms  addressing any concern as to an unfunded mandate. To reduce public health disparities; we must ensure that California youth have equitable access to condoms in high schools. Advocates for youth health and education equity urge Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign the YHES Act into law. Sergio J.

In todays world; families have numerous school choices for their children and often rely on the experiences of neighbors; family and friends for advice. Families perceptions of the school  how they feel when they walk into the front office; their ability to provide feedback and feel heard and valued; and their access to school staff  are all crucial to improving student attendance; engagement and performance. This might sound a lot like customer service; and thats precisely what it is. Just as in the business world; positive interactions between schools and their families directly influence satisfaction; loyalty and trust. According to the K12 Insight report on customer service in schools; these interactions can enhance student outcomes; enrollment; attendance and behavior. Children in poverty; children of color and children with disabilities are three times more likely to be chronically absent. A welcoming school that goes the extra mile to create a sense of belonging and build bonds with families can take proactive measures to address attendance challenges. This school year; schools should aim to create and nurture a sense of belonging and common purpose with families and the community. Here are some actionable suggestions: Create a family-friendly environment Families should feel comfortable touring and visiting the school. A welcoming environment includes convenient parking; clear signage; cleanliness; a friendly and helpful front office staff; a comfortable and inviting waiting area; translated materials; posted family engagement activities and events; and flyers informing families of enrichment opportunities available after school and in the community. When interacting with the school; families should find the staff knowledgeable; helpful and responsive to their concerns. To go the extra mile; schools can: Enhance family engagement with clear and honest communication Effective communication with families is clear; relevant and personalized. Go beyond good intentions and engage in meaningful conversations that can lead to improved student learning. Teachers can make a great first impression before school starts or at the beginning of the year by making a welcome phone call; sending a postcard; email; letter or any other form of communication that helps families get to know their childs teachers. Encourage teachers to be relatable by sharing tidbits of their own lives; being a real person goes a long way in building relationships. Let families know the best way to contact their teacher for questions; guidance or updates on student learning progress. Transparent and honest communication builds trust. Prioritize communication linked to learning. Share student progress data promptly; inform families when and how students will be tested; and show parents specific activities and strategies for home support. Report cards and parent-teacher conferences are not enough; families need concrete and personalized information and guidance to support learning. To go the extra mile: Expand engagement access for all families Traditionally; schools collect family engagement data based on family attendance at school events and activities. Often; this means counting the regulars  the ones who come time after time. This school year; challenge your team to count the families who were unable to attend the event; especially if the event is focused on student learning. Divide the number of absent families by grade level and ask teachers to reach out to their families to share the information they missed and build trust. Take this opportunity to learn more about the family; build trust; and open new lines of communication. Create space for teachers to share what they learn with their grade-level team. To go the extra mile: Genuine family engagement happens away from school  it happens at the dinner table; in car rides and during everyday parent-child interactions and family dynamics. Strengthening relationships with families can enrich the way families support learning and provide valuable insights into the children you teach. Theres something incredibly heartwarming about reading parents social media posts expressing their appreciation for their childs school. These parents highlight their favorite and trusted teachers; describe a sense of community and belonging; and invite new families to join in on school activities; volunteer opportunities; and decision-making committees. Their loyalty to the school is unmistakable. Efforts like those listed above can enable schools to build stronger; more supportive communities that foster student success and create a welcoming environment for everyone involved.

While the minimum eligibility to apply is a 3.0 GPA in UC-required courses for California residents (3.4 for non-residents) [oai_citation_attribution:0‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=%2A%20Meet%20the%20A;residents); successful applicants typically far exceed this. In fact; to be competitive at Berkeley; students generally need an academic profile much stronger than the UC minimums [oai_citation_attribution:1‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%20that%20at;University%20of%20California%20admission%20requirements). **Historical Perspective:** Admitted freshmen almost all earn A grades in high school – the middle 50% of Berkeley’s Fall 2024 admitted class had unweighted GPAs between 3.89 and 4.00 (nearly straight A’s) and weighted GPAs up to about 4.65 [oai_citation_attribution:2‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=First;4.65). The average unweighted GPA was about 3.92; with a 4.47 weighted GPA; for Fall 2024 admits; slightly higher than the prior year (4.44) [oai_citation_attribution:3‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=desirable%20destination%20for%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s;%E2%80%9D). This upward trend in admitted GPA reflects increasing competition. **Specific Data Points:** Back in Fall 2019; the admit rate was ~16% with a middle 50% weighted GPA around 4.15–4.30 [oai_citation_attribution:4‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=Applicants%3A) [oai_citation_attribution:5‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=;75%25%20students); by Fall 2024 the admit rate dropped to ~11% [oai_citation_attribution:6‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=2024%20applications%202024%20admits%202024;125%2C922%20%C2%A014%2C772%2011.2) and average GPAs rose above 4.4. Berkeley considers both weighted and unweighted GPAs; looking at performance in required “A-G” courses in 10th-11th grade and beyond. They assess not just the GPA number but also the rigor of coursework – the number of Honors; AP; IB; or college-level classes a student took; and performance relative to what was available at their school [oai_citation_attribution:7‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=;UC%20applicants%20at%20your%20school). **Holistic Nuances:** GPA is evaluated in context: readers examine grade trends (improvement or consistency); the difficulty of courses; and how the student maximized opportunities. There is no fixed “cut-off” GPA for admission; but given Berkeley’s large applicant pool; admitted students’ GPAs tend to be very high. The admissions office emphasizes that strong academics are necessary but not sufficient – nearly all applicants meet the minimum GPA; so Berkeley uses comprehensive review to go “beyond the numbers” when comparing students [oai_citation_attribution:8‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=Each%20application%20undergoes%20a%20holistic;by%20word%2C%20page%20by%20page).,2025

This policy applies to all freshman applicants as part of the University of California system’s shift away from standardized testing. **Historical Perspective:** In May 2020; the UC Board of Regents voted to suspend SAT/ACT requirements and planned a phase-out over five years [oai_citation_attribution:14‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20California%20Board;testing%20requirement%20for%20California%20students). Initially; for Fall 2021 and 2022 applicants; tests were optional; and by Fall 2023 the UC system moved to **test-blind** admissions (scores; even if submitted; could not be used) [oai_citation_attribution:15‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=%2A%20Test;for%20the%20statewide%20admissions%20guarantee). A subsequent legal settlement accelerated this timeline; so **since Fall 2021 Berkeley has not used SAT/ACT scores at all**. By 2022; UC decided not to develop a new exam; making the test-free policy permanent. **Specific Data Points:** Prior to these changes; admitted Berkeley students had very high test scores – for example; the middle 50% of Fall 2019 admits scored 30–35 on the ACT; and about 1340–1540 (combined) on the SAT [oai_citation_attribution:16‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=;75%25%20students). Now; with tests eliminated; Berkeley places greater weight on academics; essays; and extracurricular achievements. The university will still consider **AP or IB exam scores**; SAT Subject Test scores (when available in the past); or other external exams as **optional supplements** to showcase mastery [oai_citation_attribution:17‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=;exams%20and%20SAT%20subject%20exams); but **SAT/ACT scores are entirely excluded** from admission and scholarship decisions. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s comprehensive review ensures that without test scores; other factors like GPA (especially in rigorous courses); leadership; talents; and personal qualities are more closely examined [oai_citation_attribution:18‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=;UC%20applicants%20at%20your%20school) [oai_citation_attribution:19‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=Berkeley%20is%20test;in%20the%20application%20review%20process). The removal of standardized tests was partly to broaden access and equity; and officials note that it hasn’t lowered standards; as applicants continue to self-select with strong academic records. As of the Fall 2025 cycle; submitting SAT or ACT scores is neither required nor useful – **Berkeley will not look at them**. Applicants; especially international students from non-English speaking schools; may need to submit TOEFL/IELTS for English proficiency; but **no general standardized tests are used for admission review**.,2025

These prompts invite students to share personal stories and reflections on leadership; creativity; talents; challenges overcome; and more. **Historical Perspective:** The PIQ format (adopted UC-wide in 2016) has remained consistent over the past five years; but its importance has grown as applications have become more competitive and standardized tests were removed. Admissions officers use the essays to **discover and evaluate distinctions among applicants whose academic records are often very similar** [oai_citation_attribution:25‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/#:~:text=At%20Berkeley%20we%20use%20personal;insight%20questions%20to).

Common topics include leadership examples; creative projects; significant challenges; academic passions; or community involvement. Each essay is limited to 350 words; so students must be concise and reflective. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley looks for qualities such as *initiative; motivation; leadership; persistence; service to others;* and cultural awareness through these essays [oai_citation_attribution:29‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/#:~:text=;including%20it%20in%20your%20application).

Rather than requiring specific activities; the admissions readers assess how each applicant chose to spend their time and **what impact or accomplishments** they achieved in those pursuits [oai_citation_attribution:39‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=5;are%20excluded%20from%20the%20criteria). This includes traditional extracurriculars (like clubs; student government; sports; arts; and community service) as well as work experience; family responsibilities; or unique hobbies. The key is **quality and depth over quantity**: sustained commitment or notable achievements in a few areas can stand out more than superficial involvement in many. **Historical Perspective:** Over the past five years; as the applicant pool has grown and test scores were removed from consideration; Berkeley has increasingly highlighted the importance of non-academic factors. The university pioneered holistic review in the UC system; focusing on building a diverse class with varied talents and backgrounds [oai_citation_attribution:40‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/selection-process/#:~:text=UC%20Berkeley%20pioneered%20the%20holistic;applications%20where%20all%20academic%20and). This means that strong extracurriculars and personal qualities have long been important; but they may carry even more weight now in differentiating top students. Berkeley has seen applicants with leadership roles in community initiatives; significant research or coding projects; standout athletic talent; or other exceptional extracurricular accomplishments; and these experiences often complement academic strength in admissions decisions. **Specific Data Points:** There is no formula for extracurriculars; but the profile of admitted students shows high involvement: for example; a large portion of Berkeley freshmen have participated in leadership or volunteer work; and many have earned awards or distinctions in arts; science; or other fields (though the university does not publish a numeric breakdown of activities; these elements are reflected qualitatively in the *comprehensive review*). **Holistic Nuances:** Evaluators consider extracurricular achievements in the **context** of each applicant’s opportunities [oai_citation_attribution:41‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=All%20achievements%2C%20both%20academic%20and;support%20available%20in%20the%20home). They ask questions like: Did the student show initiative or hold leadership roles (formally or informally)? Did they achieve something significant or demonstrate passion and growth? How did the student balance commitments; especially if they faced obligations like part-time jobs or family care? Importantly; Berkeley defines leadership broadly – “leadership” can mean being a team captain or club president; but it can also be demonstrated through initiating a project; mentoring others; or overcoming challenges [oai_citation_attribution:42‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=Each%20application%20undergoes%20a%20holistic;by%20word%2C%20page%20by%20page). The admissions guidelines explicitly recognize *“exemplary; sustained achievement in any field of intellectual or creative endeavor; accomplishments in extracurricular activities such as the performing arts or athletics; leadership in school or community organizations; employment; and volunteer service”* as positives in an application [oai_citation_attribution:43‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=5;are%20excluded%20from%20the%20criteria). In summary; Berkeley looks for meaningful engagement: applicants who have made a positive impact or shown dedication beyond academics are viewed favorably; especially when those contributions align with their passions and the values of the university.,2025

The admissions process explicitly **does not consider race; ethnicity; gender; or religion** in compliance with California law (Proposition 209) [oai_citation_attribution:48‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=6;are%20excluded%20from%20the%20criteria). However; Berkeley **does consider the context** of each applicant’s life – factors like being a first-generation college student; coming from a low-income family or a rural area; attending a disadvantaged school; or overcoming significant hardship or disability are all taken into account as part of the holistic review [oai_citation_attribution:49‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=All%20achievements%2C%20both%20academic%20and;support%20available%20in%20the%20home).

In 2020; a state ballot measure (Prop 16) sought to reinstate affirmative action but was not passed; so Berkeley continues to pursue diversity through race-neutral means. The university has increased outreach to underrepresented communities and; as noted in 2024 admissions; about 3;800 of the admitted first-year students were from underrepresented minority groups (African American; Latinx; Native American; etc.) despite the ban on considering race [oai_citation_attribution:52‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=The%20students%20come%20from%2057;Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students). Additionally; Berkeley has steadily enrolled a significant number of first-generation college students (roughly 26% of Fall 2024 admits were first-gen) [oai_citation_attribution:53‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=From%20public%20schools%20From%20rural;26); indicating its commitment to socioeconomic diversity. **Specific Data Points:** The UC system’s *Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC)* program guarantees UC admission (though not necessarily to Berkeley) for the top 9% of students in each California high school. Berkeley gives special attention to ELC-designated applicants as part of its comprehensive review; recognizing their achievement in context. Moreover; UC policy allows for *“Admission by Exception”* – up to 6% of an incoming class can be admitted despite not meeting every UC minimum requirement; if they possess exceptional talent or come from a disadvantaged background [oai_citation_attribution:54‡calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2019/08/college-scandal-admission-exception-uc-california-side-door-sports-money-diversity-secrecy/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Varsity%20Blues%20scandal;come%20from%20a%20disadvantaged%20background). In practice; Berkeley uses this for cases like outstanding athletes; artists; or students who experienced extreme hardship that affected part of their academics. Such candidates must still demonstrate potential to succeed at Berkeley. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s review readers are trained to evaluate each file in context. They consider if the applicant had limited access to advanced courses or extracurriculars and how they made use of what was available. If an applicant has faced unusual circumstances (for example; homelessness; refugee status; significant family responsibilities; or a disability); the review will weigh the *“maturity; determination and insight”* shown in overcoming those challenges [oai_citation_attribution:55‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=All%20achievements%2C%20both%20academic%20and;support%20available%20in%20the%20home). To gather more information on special cases; Berkeley can invoke the **Augmented Review** process: a small percentage of applicants may be asked to provide additional materials; such as a questionnaire; seventh-semester grades; or up to two recommendation letters; to shed light on *“extraordinary circumstances or special talents”* [oai_citation_attribution:56‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Campuses%20may%20request%20an%20additional;that%20the%20applicant%20has%20encountered) [oai_citation_attribution:57‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Letters%20of%20recommendation%20can%20be;applicants%20given%20a%20special%20review). (Notably; UC Berkeley normally does *not* accept recommendation letters; except when an Augmented Review is triggered for a particular applicant.) **Official Validation:** All these special considerations operate within UC’s formal guidelines. For example; Regents policy caps *non-resident* enrollment (to prioritize Californians) and state law mandates race-blind admissions; but Berkeley still achieves diversity through holistic review. The **Berkeley Admissions Office and UC Office of the President** regularly report statistics on first-gen students; low-income students; and other groups to ensure transparency [oai_citation_attribution:58‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=The%20students%20come%20from%2057;Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students) [oai_citation_attribution:59‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=From%20public%20schools%20From%20rural;26). In summary; while academic excellence is key; Berkeley’s process actively accommodates **individual circumstances and exceptional talents** to admit a diverse; well-rounded freshman class.,2025

The university saw a significant **increase in applications** – from about 87;000 freshman applicants in Fall 2019 to roughly 125;000+ in Fall 2022-2023 [oai_citation_attribution:65‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=Applicants%3A) [oai_citation_attribution:66‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=2024%20applications%202024%20admits%202024;125%2C922%20%C2%A014%2C772%2011.2) – which led to lower admit rates and higher academic benchmarks.

Alongside this growth; UC Berkeley (and the UC system at large) made major policy shifts: **Standardized tests were eliminated.** In 2020; the UC Regents approved dropping the SAT/ACT requirement; by Fall 2021 admissions; Berkeley went test-optional due to the pandemic; and soon after became fully **test-blind** (not considering scores at all) [oai_citation_attribution:69‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-temporarily-eases-admissions-requirements-response-educational-disruptions#:~:text=The%20measures%20include%20suspending%20the;have%20moved%20to%20pass%2Ffail%20grading) [oai_citation_attribution:70‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-temporarily-eases-admissions-requirements-response-educational-disruptions#:~:text=UC%20has%20temporarily%20suspended%20the;enter%20UC%20as%20a%20junior). A legal agreement in 2021 ensured no UC would use test scores through 2025; and ultimately UC decided to make the change permanent. This was one of the most impactful changes in the last five years. **Historical Perspective:** The COVID-19 pandemic (2020) also forced temporary adjustments: UC suspended letter-grade requirements for A-G courses in Spring 2020 (allowing Pass/No Pass grades without penalty) and extended admissions deadlines to accommodate students [oai_citation_attribution:71‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-temporarily-eases-admissions-requirements-response-educational-disruptions#:~:text=The%20measures%20include%20suspending%20the;have%20moved%20to%20pass%2Ffail%20grading). Those measures were emergency responses and have since expired; but they set the stage for more flexible; holistic considerations (and underscored the value of looking beyond test scores). In terms of admissions strategy; Berkeley has also responded to public pressure and state mandates to prioritize California residents. **Specific Data Points:** In 2021; the California state budget and UC Board pushed campuses like Berkeley to increase in-state enrollment. As a result; Berkeley’s Fall 2024 admitted class was 79% California residents; up from 75% the year before [oai_citation_attribution:72‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=California%20residents%20admitted%20in%20alignment;the%20governor%20and%20the%20Legislature); reflecting a deliberate shift to admit more Californians. Another notable change occurred in early 2022 when a court-ordered **enrollment cap** threatened to force Berkeley to reduce admissions; this led to swift legislative action that allowed the university to resume normal admission volumes [oai_citation_attribution:73‡calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2022/03/uc-enrollment-cap-fix/#:~:text=Lawmakers%20pass%20legislative%20fix%20to;Gavin%20Newsom%27s%20desk). Berkeley did; however; slightly reduce the number of admission offers in 2024 to better control enrollment after higher-than-expected yields in prior years [oai_citation_attribution:74‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=This%20year%E2%80%99s%20admitted%20class%20faced;more%20students%20enrolled%20than%20%C2%A0anticipated). Over five years; the **academic profile** of admitted students has remained extremely high or risen – for instance; the average unweighted GPA of admits held around 3.92 [oai_citation_attribution:75‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=This%20year%E2%80%99s%20admitted%20class%20of;44%20last%20year); and the average fully weighted GPA increased (from roughly 4.4 to 4.47 between 2020 and 2024) [oai_citation_attribution:76‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=desirable%20destination%20for%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s;%E2%80%9D). Meanwhile; metrics like test scores are no longer tracked; and more emphasis is placed on qualitative factors. **Holistic Nuances:** With each passing year; Berkeley has doubled down on **holistic review**. The removal of tests meant readers consider personal insight essays and extracurriculars even more intensively to gauge traits like leadership; creativity; and resilience. During the pandemic; readers were mindful of applicants’ limited opportunities for activities or testing; and adjusted expectations accordingly. The university also updated its **Augmented Review** policy (in 2017; refined in 2022) to allow seeking additional context (including recommendation letters) for up to 15% of borderline cases [oai_citation_attribution:77‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Campuses%20may%20request%20an%20additional;that%20the%20applicant%20has%20encountered) [oai_citation_attribution:78‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Letters%20of%20recommendation%20can%20be;applicants%20given%20a%20special%20review); ensuring no student is overlooked due to unusual circumstances. In summary; the 2020–2025 period has seen Berkeley admissions become **more selective** and adapt to external challenges: testing was phased out; application numbers hit new highs; and policies were tweaked to maintain fairness and a strong commitment to in-state students. The class entering Fall 2025 will be the culmination of these trends – a class chosen entirely without test scores; with record-high applications; and with a composition shaped by the university’s focus on diversity; excellence; and resilience.,2025

Additionally; the UC Board of Regents enforces limits on out-of-state and international enrollment. At Berkeley; non-resident undergraduates have been capped at roughly the level they were in 2017 (around 24% of the student body) [oai_citation_attribution:85‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-board-regents-approves-policy-nonresident-student-enrollment#:~:text=Under%20the%20policy%2C%20the%20first;in%20the%202017%E2%80%9318%20academic%20year). In recent freshman classes; this translates to roughly 20-25% of admits being non-California students – for Fall 2024; about 21% of admitted freshmen were from out-of-state or overseas; as 79% were Californians [oai_citation_attribution:86‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=California%20residents%20admitted%20in%20alignment;the%20governor%20and%20the%20Legislature). **International Applicants:** If a student requires a visa to study; Berkeley considers them international. They must meet the same academic standards (completion of a rigorous secondary curriculum with high grades) and **demonstrate English language proficiency** if educated in a non-English environment. UC’s systemwide requirements include exams like TOEFL (minimum score 80 iBT) or IELTS (6.5+) to show English proficiency for international students [oai_citation_attribution:87‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/international-applicants/english-language-proficiency-toefl-ielts.html#:~:text=;Minimum%20score%20of%20115). International transcripts are evaluated according to country-specific contexts – for instance; A-levels; IB diplomas; or national exam results are considered alongside or in lieu of a GPA; and UC provides guidelines for different countries’ educational systems. **Out-of-State Applicants:** Students from other U.S. states are held to the same holistic criteria as Californians. There is no admission preference given to non-residents; in fact; because non-resident enrollment is capped; out-of-state applicants face a competitive process for a limited number of spots. That said; out-of-state admits at Berkeley often have academic credentials on par with the top in-state students (since all applicants compete in the same pool). **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s comprehensive review weighs achievements in context for all students; but readers will consider an applicant’s environment – for example; if an international student had to learn English recently or an out-of-state student comes from an underserved region; those factors become part of the context. No quotas exist for specific states or countries; but Berkeley strives for geographic diversity as a secondary goal. The Fall 2024 admitted students; for example; hailed from **57 U.S. states and territories and 115 countries**; indicating a broad reach [oai_citation_attribution:88‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=The%20students%20come%20from%2057;Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students). **Special Policies:** California residents have programs like Eligibility in Local Context (top 9% of their high school) which can boost their UC chances; whereas non-residents do not have ELC. Financial considerations do not directly factor into admission; but international and out-of-state students must show they can afford higher non-resident tuition (Berkeley is need-blind for U.S. students; but international applicants are not offered need-based aid). Importantly; **all applications are reviewed with the same criteria**; and every applicant; domestic or international; is expected to demonstrate academic excellence and personal accomplishments. The additional requirements for non-residents (higher GPA threshold and English testing) ensure they are prepared for Berkeley’s rigor. In summary; Berkeley maintains a balance: honoring its public mission to educate Californians first; while also selecting outstanding students globally who enrich the campus with diverse perspectives [oai_citation_attribution:89‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=The%20students%20come%20from%2057;Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students). The admissions outcomes reflect this balance; shaped by state policy (caps on non-residents) and holistic review that puts all applicants on an equal footing in terms of evaluation of merit.,2025

If that happens to you; a big reason is because there just aren’t enough spots for all the qualified applicants. You still have what it takes to thrive there. And you CAN get your degree there even if you get disappointing news today. I remember seeing my daughter’s Davis rejection letter and noticing they invited her to reapply as a transfer; mysteriously implying she could for sure get a spot if she did. So we did some research and found the TAG program; which offers guaranteed UC transfer admission in a nonimpacted major if you meet all the requirements and have above around a 3.4 (can vary by major/campus). You need 60 semester units done before starting; with 30 at a California CC; but AP/IB/dual enrollment credits can count. Many A2C students with tons of AP classes can complete the rest in just a year. You transfer in as a junior so that can basically cut the cost of college in half. Or you can often stay an extra year taking classes or earning a master’s. It’s a good deal and lets you genuinely choose your favorite of 6 UCs to have as a safety. You may also have a stronger chance in your second crack at Berkeley; UCLA or UCSD. They don’t offer guaranteed admission but SD accepts over 50% of transfer applicants (almost 70% in some pretty cool majors) and UCLA’s TAP honors programs boost your chances at admission to around 80% because you can be reconsidered for a nonimpacted L&S fall back major if you don’t get into the one you want. Those same honors programs and a 3.7 get you guaranteed transfer admission to many majors at Irvine (the nursing; arts; business and computer science colleges don’t guarantee admission but honors to honors still really boosts your chances). This means you can reapply to the UCs in a year or two and; if you take the right CCC classes with good grades; know you’ll be getting into UCI and your TAG school for sure; plus have a strong shot at UCLA. Berkeley/UCSD don’t have formal programs but tend to like those same strong students too. A big caveat: transferring is still hard in the most popular majors. Transfer admit rates for programs like nursing and CS at the top campuses are still very low. But if you are open to related majors like public health or applied math; cognitive science; statistics & data analysis or linguistics + CS; you can probably find a UC safety program you’ll like. As a freshman applicant those UC results can feel like a crap shoot. People with the same stats from your school may have quite different results. If you don’t get the acceptance letters you want from the UCs this month; take a look at these resources. Because for every 2 freshmen they admit; the UCs must accept 1 CCC transfer under state funding rules. https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/_files/documents/2025-26-tag-matrix-with-summary-of-changes.pdf https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/transfers-major https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/transfer/ucla-transfer-alliance-program https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/wp.ovptl.uci.edu/dist/e/64/files/2024/09/2024-HonorstoHonorsFlyer.pdf More here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferStudents/comments/yle2e6/useful_links_for_hopeful_uc_transfers/ My daughter did not get the UC results she wanted as a freshman applicant. The lower-tier campuses that accepted her didn’t have a major she really wanted. We also realized in April that her CSU safety program was not a good option for her. The outstanding schools she got into out of state were extremely expensive and she knew she’d prefer Irvine to any of them. So she ignored the stigma and signed up for CC. I’ve never been more proud of her. The TAG program meant she was guaranteed a transfer spot if she could just finish the requirements with a 3.4. It took a lot of research but she made a plan to reapply to just her 5 favorite UCs as a 1-year junior transfer that fall; before she even had her first semester grades. This time she got into all of them; and later started a master’s program in what would have been her senior year. Thanks to her well-planned time in CC; she now has degrees from both UCLA and Berkeley. And the cost for both was less than we paid for her sister’s UC undergraduate degree a decade ago. That Davis rejection letter led her on a journey we didn’t ever expect. So if you get disappointing news today; don’t give up. You can still go to your favorite mid-tier UC. You can honestly just choose that and make it happen by taken the right classes and keeping your grades up.
COMMENTS:
Thank you so much for sharing this insight; the links; the process; and your daughter’s story. I’ve worked with a number of students applying for transfer from cc to the UCs and it always works out so well. And I’m always super impressed with the experiences and opportunities they have at their CC campus.
This definitely made me feel better! I’ve always dreamed of attending uc Davis ever since I went to picnic day several years ago. Even if I don’t get in as a first year; the direct transfer through cc gives me hope that I can attend my dream school!
It’s such a good thing. My best friend got into a ton of schools but wanted something more prestigious/cheaper and used his APs and summer classes to go to CC. He’s doing an Honors program at a California CC that has an 80% acceptance rate to Berkeley and UCLA; and he’s guaranteed UCSB worst case scenarios. Community took him 6 months because he took summer and winter classes and had so many APs. He’s going to most likely transfer in as a Berkeley junior next fall and save a ton of money.
My daughter the the same. Opting to go to a CC in the bay area that has a program with UCSD. She is now at UCSD and loving it. The money we had saved for college that we did not spend is now hers to reinvest! When you get to UCSD they also group you in the dorms with all the other transfer students so it is very easy for hem to settle in
As a mom too with my eldest at UCI and my youngest in the decision month; this is SUCH GOOD advice! 🥰
Thank you so much for sharing this!!
How was your child's learning experience at CC compared to the big UC? Did they feel they got more personalized attention at CC? Did they find their CC peers more committed to the learning process vs being grade obsessed?
CC is an excellent option. My nephew graduated from CC; then graduated from a UC and now at Harvard for his Masters. My son is following that path BUT in a very competitive major. Aerospace Engineering. He is finishing his AA this summer as a HS student. Applied as a first year and IF no UC accepts him he will have TAG amd 5 honors courses completed which will boost his chances to be accepted as a Transfer Student; finish in two years and then straight to grad school. CC is free as a HS student. When there is a will there is always a way AND his CC professors have been really supportive and nice to him. He will graduate as one of 3 HS students from CC out of 18K students. Debt free. Please consider CC.
Saving this post. Really excellent insights; experience; and information. Would you be ok if I shared your post with some of the college essays students I worked with this cycle? I’d be glad to credit you. Completely understand if no.
My daughter got accepted at a few private universities as well as UC Santa Cruz as a HS senior two years ago. None of those options were either affordable or to her liking. She swallowed her pride and went to Santa Monica College and was able to also work 25 hours a week and build her resume. She studied hard and was able to transfer to her top choice; UCLA. For her; starting at a CC was the best thing she could have done. If there is any downside at all ; it is that she only gets two years at the college she loves. Community Colleges can be a fantastic route for many students to get where they dream of going.",2025-03-08

For some reason; I always believe that it's an early decision... but no. They just emailed me that they're giving me the opportunity to connect with future Techers; so obviously; I had another momentary heart attack. I don't even know what to feel... It's nice that they didn't throw my application in the trash; but also; I'm almost certainly going to be rejected so what's the point of this email?!? I'm so done. How am I supposed to make long-term bonds with future Techers BEFORE decisions; when ~98% of us will be rejected?! Reading this over; I have realized how insane I sound; but honestly; it's less insane than was the decision to apply to Caltech.

did you get the [ugadmits@caltech.edu](mailto:ugadmits@caltech.edu) email as well? I feel edged too like my friends took it as an acceptance and are telling everyone in the school...if i get rejected tomorrow that will be EMBARASSING
Got that email too. It has a welcome banner as well.
I also got the email! The weirdest part is that it's from ugadmits@caltech.edu. Sounds like a mistake on their part :/

Nestled in the heart of Orange County; it thrived under the soft glow of the California sun; where palm trees lined its walkways; and a cool breeze from the Pacific carried the scent of ambition. It was modern; quiet; and effortlessly nonchalant; content in its steady rise as a research powerhouse. UNC Chapel Hill; on the other hand; was history embodied. With red-brick buildings and towering oaks; it stood proudly as the nation’s first public university; a place where tradition and passion ran deep. It was fiery where Irvine was mellow; loud where Irvine was reserved; a school wrapped in legacy and painted in Carolina blue. Their paths should never have crossed. But fate—or perhaps a long-distance academic conference—had other plans. It happened in the middle of an international research symposium. Their students; their professors; their ideas collided in the way only opposites can. Irvine; with its cool West Coast intellect; intrigued Chapel Hill; who had always been drawn to things with a quiet mystery. And Chapel Hill; with its deep sense of history and purpose; fascinated Irvine; who often wondered what it would be like to wear tradition like a second skin. They spent late nights exchanging philosophies—Chapel Hill spoke of its love for basketball; its historic bell tower; the way fall turned the campus into a watercolor painting. Irvine listened; entranced; then shared stories of Aldrich Park’s endless green; the science labs that hummed with discovery; and the oddly charming cry of Zot Zot Zot. They challenged each other. Irvine reminded Chapel Hill that the future was just as important as the past. Chapel Hill showed Irvine that sometimes; to know where you’re going; you have to embrace where you’ve been. And somewhere between the intellectual debates and the long-distance letters carried by students traveling coast to coast; they fell in love. Of course; it wasn’t always easy. They were separated by thousands of miles; by time zones and cultures and a rivalry between West Coast calm and Southern pride. But they made it work—through joint research programs; through study-abroad opportunities; through students who carried pieces of both in their hearts. And so; UC Irvine and UNC Chapel Hill became the kind of love story that defied distance; the kind where the West Coast sun and the Southern sky found harmony; where old met new and built something timeless.

She applied to college in fall 2012 and took 3 classes. She eventually stopped going and received a ‘W’ for two of the classes; and a ‘F’ for one. Then she applied again in the following spring of 2013 for 3 classes and ended up not going again and received the same result (2 ‘W’s and 1 ‘F’). This was over ten years ago while she was going through active addiction and was in a 6 year; abusive relationship with a pword. She is now in a safer position; and is sober and ready to take college seriously to improve her future. What does her academic history and GPA mean for her application process? Will she be rejected? Is there an appeal process? Will it affect her ability to receive financial aid?
COMMENTS:
She should start in community college and transfer to a four-year college after completing an associate’s degree. It will be cheaper and probably a better fit given how long it’s been since she was last in school.
I agree she should start in a community college to rehabilitate her GPA and to show colleges that she has grown and will do the work. She will have to share the transcript from the original college from 2012 and 2013. She can address her growth in her essays
CC is the move. They’ll almost certainly accept her. But even before registering for classes it’s smart to start off researching online exactly what the university and major you want to graduate from will look for in transfers. They may want to see specific classes or grades and require a specific number of units. Best to know that and sign up for those.
There are also programs (and scholarships) for ""non-traditional"" students. If she can score well on an SAT or ACT; that might be another pathway.
Most community colleges take everyone who would like to go. That’s part of their mission.
the title is very deceiving i was about to come and ""troll"" by saying accepted at mit and caltech or something 😭 on a much more serious note; i agree with all of the comments posted here and im so glad to hear that your friend is doing much better now. youre a great friend for trying to help her. best of luck to her in her college endeavours!
Does she still live locally to the college she dropped out off? If so; she can contract the registrar and ask about their readmission process. Colleges also have a process to retroactively remove Ds and Fs.",2025-03-08

COMMENTS:
As someone with ECs you can consider “good”; I didn’t anything like band or sports or even any competitions really. I did Science fair in my Junior year but I didn’t really go anywhere with it. It’s not necessarily about winning; it’s about demonstrating passion. I did art and writing just by myself; wrote a 47k word novel. I did weekly volunteering at a cat rescue my junior year; 4 year club officership where I made changes to my school. You don’t have to go for what seems like traditional. Go for what genuinely interests you and for what you enjoy. Do stuff that you can talk about and people can tell you like it. Don’t feel too much pressure on if it’s a “good” EC. Put effort and time into it and I guess try for some stuff that has change and impact. There’s stuff you can do to try to make things better if you try to find it.

It seems like no one cares if you know anything but they want the degree credential. Just because you have a degree does not mean you are smart; hard working or have any skill
COMMENTS:
A degree is valuable because it shows you know things. Idk what to tell you. When you just say ""but I swear I know how to do it!""; it means nothing because you can just lie.
A degree *is* valuable. A college education *is* valuable; *especially* if one goes to a high quality university or interacts with (highly) competent professors. I agree that it doesn’t necessarily mean that “you are smart; hard working; or have any skill.” But it sure as shit can help *a lot*.
You might think that; but as a college professor I see the students who fail out. You do NOT want to hire the students that fail out. So actually a college degree ensures you get a a muuuuch higher quality candidate. People who dismiss this idea think college is easy; because they are capable. College ain't easy for everyone.
Because an HR person doesn’t have all day to sit over your shoulder while you prove you know something they don’t understand. Imagine being a homelab networking guywith no certs/degrees/anyrhing and all she sees on a resume is John Doe Homelab experience: 10 years McDonald’s 10 years
You are correct. At my brothers company they won't even consider anyone who doesn't have a bachelors degree for a management position; even if you have several years of relevant experience; it doesn't even matter what the degree is in as long as you have a degree. It's completely ridiculous but I guess they assume that if you were able to complete a degree; you must be at least somewhat competent and somewhat intelligent...I read somewhere that the average IQ of a college student in America is around 100-110 and average IQ is 90-100; so there is some level of truth to it i.e if you have a college degree; you're probably at least of average intelligence and competent enough to do the job... but the issues is that education has become a classism things and there are lots of intelligent people who didn't go to school because they couldn't afford it OR didn't want to get into crushing debt. When mom and dad are paying for everything and you don't have the stress of working part time or not knowing how you're going to pay your bills; obtaining a degree is much easier and put you ahead of someone who comes from a lower income situation. Anyway; I would argue that you do need a base level of intelligence and work ethic to obtain a degree in any field. Someone who is below average intelligence would really struggle in University and likely wouldn't be able to hack it...that's not me trying to sound better than anyone else; it's just the reality of college/university...it's not easy no matter what your major is. Could someone slip through the cracks? of course...but it's highly unlikely and in general; most people who earn a degree are relatively intelligent.
Pretty much. Having to go back now because I've been made to do jobs only to be turned down later and told I'm not qualified. Shake lots of hands; build actionable resume points. You're there to benefit from any nepotism you can wriggle into.
Depends on the industry. In IT and cybersecurity; experience is still king.
Having a degree shows that you're capable of following some guidelines; memorizing a bunch of info and then presenting it and perhaps applying a method shown to you previously. Those are the skills most employers care about.
People can say that college makes you a better person; smarter or whatnot; but what it really boils down to is the fact that it helps businesses filter out candidates. You have to think of it from the perspective of the business. They want the best employee so they'll find ways to sort out who are the most ideal candidates. A college degree is one of the most common ways. In my opinion; there are other ways employers can sort out of candidates like through iq tests and aptitude tests but using these are controversial. Therefore; those of us who just want to improve our job prospects and don't really care about the college experience have to jump through all these hoops.
A degree *should* mean you are capable of communicating well; thinking analytically; and working autonomously. Sadly; it has been watered down substantially over the last few decades.",2025-03-08

First Time posting here. Encountering a bit of difficulty in my school/healthcare education and i'm interested in some opinions on this. I did well in my program; and was selected to complete a rotation in a fast-paced healthcare field at my very first hospital of choice- a location i've totally dreamt of as a little kid. Both of my parents have worked here in different capacities. I was expecting this to be my fairytale; but i've been met with difficulties. my two preceptors are both 10-15 year veterans in this field. while this can be a very serious career; with life-threatening work on the heart being done---- They seem to have a very little amount of patience; willingness to teach outside of required materials; and generally seem bothered by my *obvious* amount of incompetence- constant eyerolling; sighing; etc. I do not expect much congeniality from physicians either; but they have been brutal as well. I don't consider myself a bad student; but I have no comparison from other classmates or employees.. I'm feeling generally uncomfortable; unwelcome; and stunted in my learning (to a degree). Although I am consistently told this is one of the best locations; I'm unsure of what to do. I've completed ~275/1200 hours.. After 8 weeks; I've been shrugged off multiple times with regards to obtaining a proper badge; or identification that allows me to access parking; or other areas of the hospital that i'm required to attend meetings/procedures inside of. The Human resources department has not responded to any of my emails after discussion of a small contingent job to make some money on the side of this student work. Texts/Emails/In-person attempts have all been avoided.. I feel like I'm unwanted- or I'm being pushed out? I'm unsure of how to proceed; entirely. Am I being too sensitive? Do I need to request a new rotation site? Do I get my university involved? Do I need to suck it up? Thank You all!

I’m a freshman; and my passion is to fight human trafficking and work in war-affected areas—specifically helping survivors of wartime sexual violence. But I’m struggling to figure out the right path. I chose International Relations because I thought it was the closest to this field; but I feel like I’m not learning as much as I expected. I like the subject; but my school doesn’t offer strong courses for it. Unfortunately; transferring isn’t an option because of the huge scholarship I’m receiving. Another challenge is that I don’t know how to actually get there—I know where I want to go; but not how to reach the people I want to help. My school’s career center and professors mostly just say; “Get experience through internships; and your major fits your goal;” which is true; but I need more specific guidance and real stories from people who’ve done this work. I also know that many different majors can lead to this field; so I’m wondering: * Should I stick with my major and plan to specialize in my master’s; even if I don’t learn much in my undergrad? * Or should I switch majors? If so; what major would better prepare me? * How can I practically prepare for this career while in college? * Any advice for an international student hoping to get a job in this field in the U.S. or abroad? 💡 I don’t have to stay in the U.S. after graduation—if there’s a better opportunity elsewhere; I’m very willing to move. So ANY advice is welcome! I know these are broad questions; but I’ve researched a lot and still feel lost about where to start. I’d really appreciate any advice; personal experiences; or even small tips you can share. Thank you so much! 🙏
COMMENTS:
Nonprofits. Try to find a local sexual violence shelter your are probably not going to find a local shelter that specifically about war time sexual violence unless you are in New York or major global cities in US. Also not to scare you but unfortunately it's not a good time to join Nonprofit because the current presidential administration is trying to stop all funding for nonprofit organizations. So if the nonprofit gets federal government funds it might not be a good time to join
Honestly… Have a plan to financially support yourself aside from working in this area. Your job won’t cover living expenses. And can’t get a visa for this type of job in the USA realistically. You’ll have to move back to your home country. There are many ways to support this field without being directly involved also - donating money; advocacy; etc often helps MORE than working for a nonprofit (harsh truth). Consider is read getting a degree in psychological counseling or social work. You couldn’t do a lot donating your time to victims and also making a living.
You should get a masters for international work! Also like others said start volunteering for non-profits especially those helping women in need. The best thing about your route is volunteering is easy to do and a great resume builder. Also have you considered federal or international law enforcement? They have a bunch of agencies that combat human trafficking. Also i would consider dropping christian studies; maybe pick up something like social work; or justice studies. International relations will very likely cover more; they have to build a large foundation of history and policy before moving to the complex things. Especially for those not quite educated on specific subject.
If you can; switch majors. International Relations is fine; but in the humanitarian sector there is a need for nutritionists; supply chain and logistics specialists; accountants; engineers; farmers/agricultural scientists; economists etc. so no you are not behind if the IR classes aren't strong; buffer it with other classes. If you can take project management and budget classes; you will be very valuable to any organisation. Take writing and communications classes; cause those are major gaps in the sector. You can get your foot in the door by volunteering with any of the non profits in your area; if you can afford to do this throughout college you will have a head start. All that being said; the sector is facing a funding crisis with US and major European countries cutting funding. DC was the best place for internships and over night it's all gone/going. There is still hope; you just have to cast a wide net.",2025-03-08

I am currently in an English writing class online. It is a short semester class (starting in January and ending in March). Everything was fine until I submitted my first essay. I received a zero on my first essay; which brought my grade down to 45. I set up a meeting with my professor to understand why I received a zero. She told me it was because my essay came back 77% AI. I was confused because I never used AI. So we went back and recounted all that I did on the essay. Well; come to find out; it is because I used Grammarly to fix a couple of grammar mistakes. I did not know that Grammarly was considered AI; as I had been using it for my other classes; and MY college gave it to us for free. She explained she understood; and that is why she sent an email detailing the use of Grammarly. Well; I apologized for my mistake and took full accountability. I accepted my zero; stopped using Grammarly; enlisted help from my sister and my coworkers; and even uninstalled it from my computer. Note: that she also said that if I needed the grade at the end of the course; she would let me re-write the essay. Fast forward to yesterday; I submitted my LAST paper for this class and I received another zero! She said I used AI again; 40%. Which drops my grade from 90 to 67. This time; I was extra confused because I knew for sure I had never used AI. Upset; I emailed her to let her know that since the first incident; I have never used AI. I told her that I had the rough draft and outline to prove that I did not use it. I spent hours writing this essay and my psychology essay at the same time. I even had my sister; who is an English teacher; and some of the teachers at my job re-read it. And it doesn't make sense that I would use AI on the very last paper of this class that is worth the most points. I mentioned that I had turned in multiple essays before this that were not flagged and didn't do anything differently. So why would I use AI now! .** Side note: in one of my other classes; we had a discussion on AI; and I asked my teacher privately how Turnitin detects AI because I received a zero in another class. She explained that she put her own written words into the AI checker; and it came back 74%. She said that it was not accurate and no professor should use it as a means to grade a student but use their judgment. That's what that professor; who is also a superintendent; said. ** Well; I guess she did not like the tone of my email or whatever and replied that I never mentioned my sister was an English teacher. She questioned the validity of my essays because the email style that I sent to her didn't match my writing style. She mentioned she saw I did well on all the other essays. She says AI detects AI; so; of course; humans wouldn't detect it. She also mentions that I admitted to using Grammarly before; so that knocks down some of the validity. She ended the email by asking if there was anything else she needed to know. As if I was keeping secrets from her. Still clearly upset; I emailed her back to let her know that I didn't appreciate her accusing me of letting my sister write my papers. I explain comparing how I write emails and how I write essays makes no sense. I love writing; so I put forth a lot of effort into writing. I try to make sure my writing is perfect. Emails are emails. I also mentioned that she glossed over that I let MULTIPLE people re-read my essay; not just this one but every single one in her class. I let her know I work in a high school with English teachers; so I have also let them re-read my essays. We get free tutoring through the school where we can submit papers and people re-read them. I saw no difference between letting the people around me re-read the essays and letting the English department at my school re-read them. I let her know that I have never needed anyone or AI to write my essays. She hasn't emailed me back yet. I worked really hard on this essay and even lost some sleep trying to finish this essay and my psychology essay which were due at the same time. It just seems crazy to me that the FIRST and LAST essays were flagged for AI but none of the ones between. I am not saying that my professor is out to get it because she's never given that; but it doesn't make sense! Everyone says I should appeal the grade. I don't know how to go about this. Am I overreacting?
COMMENTS:
do you write your essays with google documents? if so theres version history so you can objectively prove you wrote it
File a formal grade dispute with the department. Gather all of your drafts. Make sure you can explain the ideas in your essay. That's all you can do.
I would probably just go set up a meeting with or email the department head. This seems inconsistent and the variation in grading is extreme. I have also put published papers and non-published paper (ranging from this year back 12 years) and there is wildly ranging percentiles. The reality is AI looks at specific writing styles and methods at a syntax level. If you write with a similar style and pattern it is a higher likelihood it comes back as AI. This is because programs like ChatGPT do not inherently vary the syntax usage. Using grammarly and saying that is the same at ChatGPT is ridiculous. Grammerly has the same skill level as an undergrad writing tutor. There is inherently no difference fixing a comma splice with a writing tutor vs. a computer program. Do we could spell check as AI? No; because it isn’t. To distill all writing programs to that level is asinine. Also; as someone who has worked with writers from elementary school through doctoral programs; the shift in style because of so much editing advice is incredibly common. People write in their own voice and style and when people help to edit; it jumbles things around. That’s why papers with multiple authors are so easy to tell who wrote what sections unless someone specifically looks for it. Funny enough; that comment should have been a red flag that this wasn’t AI; because AI would have used consistent syntax style. I would try to find out the university and department policies on AI use going forward. Also; use something where you can watch edits in real time (google docs and Word with OneDrive do this). I would also document these cases in the event it happens in the future.
I’d speak with the dean. Using Grammarly to fix grammar issues (especially when given to you free by the school) is a stretch saying it’s AI. My son taught at the local community college. His school did not allow instructors to use AI detectors. If you wanted to accuse a student of using AI you had to do the legwork yourself to prove the student used AI.
We had a prof have an actual mental breakdown over thinking almost every person was using AI. Like; emotional long emails multiple times a day over several months. Our school also provided grammarly to all students. I quit the class because the woman was genuinely losing it and trying to fail a majority of the class instead of believing that there’s a technical issue going on. I’m not sure how she resolved those feelings.
not overreacting at all; ive been in a similar boat and it is an enraging experience. If you dont mind; I have a bit of advice Appeal the grade; fight fight fight. After my accusations last semester; I provided copies and drafts of all of my work; change history; and other document metadata to tutors who helped connect me to other english professors who validated my work. I also emailed the department head as I was insulted by the professor; and his use of third party ai detection tools violated the faculty handbook. it was exhausting and i had to keep fighting. I can tell this it taking a toll on your mental health; it did for me too. If you have any campus mental health resources; they may be able to help you resolve this
Offer to sit in her office and write something for her to prove that you can write at the level she seeks.
AI detectors don't work and there's plenty of research to prove it. I'd formally appeal. https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/
In this case I’d go to the department chair. But r/askprofessors might have more insight

D3 recruiting would have opened the door to many T20 schools; especially LACs like Williams; Pomona; Bowdoin and larger schools like Chicago; CMU; JHU. If your ECs/LORs/awards are good enough for USC/Michigan; you certainly have a short at Yale with double legacy

Some of those schools will want a higher SAT (UMich / UIUC / Rice) UCSD doesn't consider SATs but it's extremely difficult to get in for CS let alone as an international OOS. Close to impossible. Rest you're probably good for; maybe UW might be a tad bit harder.
Are you full pay?
I think you're in for UW Madison; Purdue; and UCSD. for the others I'm not sure.

Sorta
If those “bad grades” you had in that one semester didn’t have any grade drop below a B+; you’re fine. Pretty much every T20 (save for Harvard; Caltech; and MIT) won’t bat an eye.
Btw 3.9 isnt a bad GPA for T20 and T20 recalculate your gpa in science area.So if your science/math notes higher they can mostly consider you 4.0GPA
Yea pretty terrible
That’s a pretty solid GPA! I’d say that’s probably the minimum for T20s",2025-03-08

Whats your UC unweighted gpa and capped gpa?
I hope that you will get into all of them; since I also wanna go for AE/ME with similar profile. The only difference is higher GPA and that I have 2 more years to do stuff; since I'm sophomore. Best of luck tho!
Are you from Georgia or NY?
You can generally crawl back from a bad sophomore year; especially with documented medical corcumstances. And hispanic males are definitely not a major part of stem. Are you a first gen college student? And are you a U.S. citizen? I asked only because you don't mention it. Similar posters tend to list their citizenship status.
I think Cornell is your best shot. And I would not be surprised if you get in.

I just got a likely letter from Yale; and while I should be over the moon; I’m honestly freaking out because… well; my entire application was a complete fabrication. Let me explain. On paper; I look like the perfect candidate. I’m the founder of a nonprofit that provides clean water to underserved communities (totally made up); a nationally ranked debater (never debated a day in my life); and a published researcher in molecular biology (I Googled some big words and slapped my name on a paper I didn’t write). My essays? Pure fiction. I wrote about how overcoming my fear of public speaking by performing stand-up comedy at a homeless shelter changed my life (I’ve never done stand-up; and the closest I’ve been to a homeless shelter is driving past one). Oh; and here’s the kicker: I didn’t even write my essays. My cousin’s friend who’s like; really good at English wrote them for me. She’s in grad school or something; so she knows how to make stuff sound smart. I just gave her some vague ideas; and she turned it into this whole masterpiece about “finding my voice through adversity” or whatever. Honestly; I don’t even know what half of it means; but it sounds impressive; so whatever. And the SAT? Yeah; I didn’t take that either. My neighbor’s kid is some math genius; and he took it for me. I paid him $200 and a promise to help him get a fake ID. He got a 1580; which is way higher than I would’ve gotten; so… win-win; right? But here’s where it gets… complicated. The *real* version of my application—the one I didn’t submit—is a lot less impressive and a lot more… let’s just say; *unconventional*. If Yale knew the truth; they’d probably rescind my acceptance before I could even finish this sentence. For starters; my *real* extracurriculars include: * Running an underground poker ring in my school’s basement (I may or may not have used my math skills to calculate odds and clean out half the football team). * Writing anonymous fanfiction for a *very* niche community (let’s just say it involves pirates; time travel; and a lot of… creative liberties). * Being the unofficial “relationship consultant” for my friend group (I may have accidentally caused two breakups and one very awkward throuple situation). And my essays? Oh; boy. The *real* personal statement I almost submitted was about how working as a barista taught me the art of seduction. Yes; seduction. I wrote about how crafting the perfect latte foam is a metaphor for building emotional connections; and how I once used my “skills” to talk a customer out of ordering a pumpkin spice latte in June. It was… a lot. But the pièce de résistance? My letters of recommendation. I almost asked my boss at the local movie theater to write one; and let’s just say it would’ve been… interesting. He once told me I was “the most creative employee he’s ever had” after I convinced a group of teenagers that the popcorn machine was haunted. I’m pretty sure he would’ve included that story. So yeah; I’m sitting here with a likely letter from Yale; knowing full well that the person they think I am doesn’t exist. The real me is a chaotic mess who spends way too much time on Reddit and not enough time doing anything remotely impressive. But here’s the kicker: part of me wonders if Yale would actually prefer the real version of my application. I mean; who wouldn’t want a student who can negotiate a truce between warring friend groups; write steamy pirate fanfiction; and run a semi-illegal poker ring? That’s gotta count for something; right? Anyway; I’m not sure what to do now. Do I come clean and risk losing my spot? Or do I double down and hope I can fake my way through four years of Ivy League education?

If this story is true; I hope you realize that you are known as what is called a “fraud”. Good look if Yale reaches out and wants you to verify your ECs. Also; how will you succeed at Yale if you can’t even get a good score on the SAT; which contains content that maxes up to 7th or 8th grade math/reading proficiency.
Bro; just work on charging your ways while at Yale; and delete this post. Nobody will find out if you don’t talk about it.",2025-03-08

COMMENTS:
dude your backstory and achievements match up so well. I'm surprised not a single top 5 school accepted you. Really unique and strong profile.
Great stats! Anyone is glad to have you. I know certain top 5 schools don’t take a lot of transfers; which would be your biggest roadblock; not your stats. It sounds like you are already at a phenomenal school. Would a general biology major at your current school give you the outcome you want; with doing electives; research and internships in the specific areas you are interested in? A lot of schools have broad majors; and you can specialize as an upperclassmen.
which school are you at currently?
You really do not want to transfer to a true T5. They are all *residential* universities; and you do not want to share a room with a 20-year-old. Even if you managed to get assigned to graduate housing; it would be very isolating. It sounds like; assuming everything you wrote is true; you're already at a school good enough that there is no ceiling on your grad school options. I think ""Human Biology"" is unique to Stanford; and the core classes are done as a sophomore. It's hard to imagine a ""political"" situation at a T15 that won't be an issue at a T5.
I think you can easily",2025-03-08

This is still a fairly big disadvantage for t20s and your ECs would need to compensate for it. What’s your weighted and unweighted GPA?
The UCs do it this way but most other schools on the east coast I don’t think do. But UCs also don’t count 9th grade. But Bs aren’t going to totally tank you if 11th grade looks better for T30 at least.

COMMENTS:
A 3.88 UW will get past the filter; the filter is set low (3.2ish) for people with extenuating circumstances. Your GPA is fine as long as you got those grades in hard classes or as an underclassman.
Senior grades count more than others. Bad senior grades can sink you. The college GPA is unweighted; only includes 10-12 grade *academic* classes; and does not include plusses or minuses. A+ is 4 points. A B- is 3 points. So now calculate your GPA. Don't include art or PE or Keyboarding or Home Ec or any other random class. Two Bs in your senior year in academic subjects will severely hurt your chances of getting in. That would represent like 40% of your reported senior year grades.
My roommate at an ivy had a 3.7. She got only B’s and 1 C but it worked out. She had a great application outside of it though and a 3.7 is still good
3.88 is literally all A's tf?
The process is that you first get through the 'gatekeeper' with the proof of your ability to meet the academic standards and rigor. This would be straight A's; usually in top 10% of class (at minimum); and a high SAT score or all 5s on APs. Then you have the essays; EC's; and things like music or art supplements (which are sent to respective departments to review and score). A 3.88 is low and everything else would have to be amazing (ie like SAT or AP scores).",2025-03-08

Cal graduate here. You'll get into some UCs but it's hard to tell with Berkeley and UCLA cuz they're so competitive. Pretty much almost everyone who gets in; has top grades and background. The thing to remember is that all of the UCs have really good professors who teach there.
I think your odds are much better than getting into the other two. The UC admit process has lost all credibility with me; so I can't give you a percentage; but UCSB is a better quality of life choice than either of those schools; and practically any school is fine for econ. UCSB alumni tend to love the college experience.

My heart goes out to anyone in this server who has been impacted by drink spiking*. FACTS: Overall; there are about 100-200 reports of spiking* a week; there are very very few successful prosecutions and the crime goes unreported 40% of the time. There are various solutions to protect your drink and despite having high success rates; the products are very obvious and may offend people at parties. SOLUTION: As a frequent partygoer and member of a sorority at UC Berkeley; my favorite solution is something called **Spikey**. It’s a keychain that detects drugged drinks within 15 seconds or less.

The above; I should have noted was for 2024; not 2025 which is still a work in progress. An easy way for both to get a lot of full-pay non-residents is to ratchet up the international and OOS students; with OOS having the lowest yields of both sets of non-residents for both UCLA and UC Berkeley. But B's international yields outpace its CA residents; International >> CA > OOS; whereas UCLA's is seemingly more normal; CA >> International > OOS. Both UCLA and UC Berkley have reduced international-student enrollment in 2024 compared to previous years; some of this was B shorting its freshmen class by ~ 500 students as an ""overenrollment"" correction from previous years. This correction included B also taking a higher percentage of CA students; 83.4% of its total freshman class compared to UCLA's 78.8%; I believe to meet state-imposed mandates. But both are severely overenrolled; and some of the other UCs need to step up their enrollments. Here are the totals by residential cohort for each; Enrolled/Accepted/Applied: **UCLA** CA Residents: 5;336/8;795/92;290; AR%=9.53%; Y%=60.67% OOS Residents: 958/2;949/31;841; 9.26%; 32.50% International: 479/1;384/22;119; 6.26%; 34.60% Total: 6;773/13;128/146;250; 8.98%; 51.59% **UC Berkeley** CA Residents: 5;178/10;766/72;129; 14.93%; 48.10% OOS Residents: 636/2;184/29;755; 7.34%; 29.10% International: 396/751/22;320; 3.36% 52.70% Total: 6;210/13;701/124;204; 11.03%; 45.33% So both UCLA and B enrolled only 479 and 396 internationals; totaling 7.1% and 6.4% of the each's respective freshman class; and as noted above; B had a 52.70% yield for this subset which is astronomical; and UCLA had a 34.60% rate which is excellent also. (UCLA gets a better yield from its OOS students and a lot higher yield than B from its CA residents.)

What am I gonna do about all the accounts I opened with this email 😭 I don’t even know how many sites I need to change my email on. This sucks so bad
COMMENTS:
Just go to information services to migrate to a @g.ucla.edu address. You keep the same username but you migrate to a new google interface. Oddly enough; you're able to still send and receive even without the ""g."" in the address.
Weird. I graduated in 1992 and recently discovered that I still have an at [ucla.edu](http://ucla.edu) email address. Just tested it and it still works! That said; I replied to the message and it came from at ""g.ucla.edu""
I thought you would be able to forward your emails to another address; but you kept the UCLA email. Not sure if it is still like that
I also graduated Fall 2024 and received this email today. According to [this website](https://ucla.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sys_id=KB0010987) we should be “Degreed Alumni” and retain access to email (but not drive; etc.). I submitted a support ticket to UCLA IT asking for clarification and you probably should too.
Your google workspace account is deleted but you retain forwarding. So you won’t be able to use the google drive the university pays for; for example
I did not get this email
There's a lot of wrong information in the replies. If you graduate from UCLA with a degree; you retain your Google Workspace account. Google Drive is disabled and your quota is set to 5GB. If you are using anything on Drive; I believe it will be deleted so back it up. If you are using more than 5GB of email; you'll get reminded to delete and then your entire account will be deleted and recreated to zero you out. (The delete/recreate might also happen if you don't delete your drive content; I don't remember what the policy was for that.) The message that you received indicating that your Google Workspace account was going to be deleted was likely not intended to go to you. During the most recent run of deactivation messaging; a number of them were sent incorrectly. You can reach out to the IT Support Center and they will confirm your status. Google Workspace emails are all in the ""g.ucla.edu"" domain. There is an alias overlay for ""ucla.edu"" that matches the g.ucla.edu username and delivers to the g.ucla.edu mailbox. You can configure your SendAs settings to send as the ucla.edu address if you want. Or you can leave it as g.ucla.edu. I'd suggest leaving it as that is what maps to the Workspace domain; but your choice. Strong recommendation in general that you establish a ""permanent"" email address that you will use for things that isn't your ucla.edu email (or g.ucla.edu); and set up your Google account to forward to your permanent account. Start moving your subscriptions and other over to your new account. That will insulate you from any policy changes around email at UCLA that might otherwise impact you later.
Also got the email as a fall 2024 grad; ig they assumed if you aren’t affiliated with UCLA anymore and you didn’t graduate in June then you dropped out lol
I got a similar email after graduating ‘24. It said my ucla email would be deleted bc of exceeding the storage limit as Almuni. I ended up keeping my ucla email by simply deleting lots of stuff to not exceed the storage limit.",2025-03-08

Yet when they were caught; they received nothing but a reprimand with no real consequences. UCLA basically wants us to cheat. What's the point of even trying?
COMMENTS:
This would keep me up at night if I didn't remind myself that half of them are pre-meds who won't get decent scores on the MCAT.
Going through procedures to get people in trouble is horrible. It’s meeting after meeting where cheating students are belligerent and allowed to lie. We have to be very selective about who we can formally go after. There are 20x more people cheating than we can actually prosecute. It’s fucking horrible.
I can think of two big reasons: 1. Burden of proof. There’s been people who’s been accused of cheating but didn’t. This leads into point 2. 2. Every student is an individual and should receive a fair case. It’s not fair to start being bitter with the process and system just because a lot of people do it.
Probably because it requires proof of the cheating; which can be hard to do in many cases; and would require a LOT for time & resources from the university to constantly pursue when there are other things to focus on
The point of trying is YOU learning. What does it matter what others are doing
Maybe start by not making things absurdly difficult or enforcing a pre-set bell curve just to maintain an artificial sense of prestige. The real issue isn’t just that UCLA doesn’t punish cheating—it’s that the entire system incentivizes it. Admins pressure professors to make courses harder; not to improve learning outcomes; but to preserve UCLA’s reputation as a “competitive” school. That way; students who survive the ordeal become walking advertisements for the university’s prestige; proving they can endure arbitrary difficulty. And let’s be honest: the people who succeed in this system aren’t always the ones who actually learned the material. They’re the ones who adapted—whether that means grinding endlessly; finding loopholes; or; for some; outright cheating. But when professors are forced to adhere to a strict bell curve; even if every student in the class theoretically deserves an A; a certain percentage will still have to fail. That’s not education—it’s manufactured scarcity. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: UCLA cultivates an environment where stress is sky-high; grades are unpredictable; and students are expected to “just deal with it” because it’s part of the school’s branding. But let’s take it further—what happens in a hyper-competitive environment? It breeds insecurity and total envy. Because getting into UCLA isn’t enough. You don’t just play the game once; you have to play it over and over again. First; you claw your way in through brutal admissions. Then; once you’re here; the game resets: now you have to outcompete your peers all over again—through exclusive consulting clubs; Greek life hierarchies; Sharpe Fellows; student government; research labs; you name it. The same cutthroat selection process that got you into UCLA just replicates itself at the club level; the internship level; the job level. And what happens to those who get sidelined? What’s left for the people who aren’t handpicked for these elite circles? Are they just supposed to sit back; buy some hot dogs; and cheer for the athletes who represent a school that doesn’t even prioritize their futures? Because let’s be real—UCLA makes it clear where its priorities lie. It enforces this grind mentality on students but has no problem spending millions on things that don’t actually improve post-grad outcomes. Instead of increasing its budget for employer relations; strengthening industry pipelines; or expanding career support; it pours money into athletic programs and unnecessary campus renovations. The irony? The engineering building—not the trendy CS or Biomed/Neuro ones; but the actual core engineering infrastructure—is falling apart. And the moment students call this out; UCLA’s response is predictable: *Surprise! We are not a vocational or trade school!*As if that excuses their failure to bridge the gap between academia and the job market. As if it justifies prioritizing aesthetics and school spirit over ensuring their graduates actually succeed. They can rationalize it however they want; but at the end of the day; a university’s purpose should be preparing students for their careers—not acting like a luxury brand; a credentialing gatekeeping cash cow that coasts on reputation while ignoring the cracks (sometimes literal ones) in its foundation. So the real question is: If UCLA isn’t serious about making its students more employable; if it doesn’t care about the structural issues driving cheating; and if it continues to treat suffering as a proxy for prestige; then what exactly *is* it trying to prove? That the brand matters more than the education? That endurance is more valuable than competence? That students should struggle for the sake of struggle? Because if that’s the message; then maybe it’s UCLA—not the students—doing the real cheating.
jon jones became a GOAT by cheating
It is definitely not without consequence. I was once suspected of cheating by one of my professors simply because I was a freshman at the time; didn’t memorize my UID; and went to my bag at the end of the test to get my card and it was reported to Dean. And what followed was a long ordeal and waiting; I was threatened with suspension even though I really hadn’t done anything; and neither the professor nor Dean gave me any chance to explain. All I’m saying is that UCLA will first incriminate you until you can find crucial evidence that proves your innocence. I’m still in a huge mental stress and depression because of this to this day; and it’s even affecting my other classes; so I don’t think it’s no cost for real cheaters who might be taking on as much mental stress and depression as I am.
This is an open secret at our school. Think about it; a large proportion of incoming freshman get placed in academic probation because they may have had an easy teacher or cheated in high school and suddenly they hit a wall. A good ethics committee that monitors cheating effectively is needed across the disciplines. Many fraternities have their own exam banks for members only. This school is such a joke when it comes to teaching cheaters not to cheat anymore. It's more obsessed with making money and going great lengths.
Not a UCLA student; this just got recommended to me but it’s across all universities; not just you. My dad is a professor at a big state school in Florida and apparently this is a widely discussed topic among faculty and administration (so yes; cheaters reading this- they know). Shit like Chegg and Quizlet were already a huge problem and now with ChatGPT? Forget about it. The thing is; they know when something is written by AI; even if it’s tweaked a little. They also notice when a student who never pays attention in class; or has poor attendance; or exhibits any of the other signs that they don’t give a fuck (because “oh well I just learn it all myself by studying” is not believable when you don’t show up or goof off the whole class) is getting A’s on everything. They know. As other commenters have said; the whole process is a can of worms. First; there’s the issue of actually proving it and not just knowing it. Second; there’s the issue of applying the standards- cheating is *rampant.* To really address it and not just target specific students; they’d have to go after a lot of people; and it’s just not feasible. The process is slow and arduous. Finally; there’s the brass tacks issue- the consequences. Suppose these kids get brought through the process and kicked out- what then? *All* of them? Arbitrarily selecting students to punish for cheating; even if they can prove it; is a headache. That’s a lot of tuition to the school lost to implement blanket policies. There’s also the matter of the parents. Tons of parents will go to the wall for their kids; even in flagrant cases; and be a huge headache for the administration. We all know it’s true- these kids don’t care because they’re spoon fed and genuinely don’t believe they should have to work hard; and it’s 100% their parents’ fault. TLDR: the schools all know; and they’re trying to figure it out. My Alma Madre has a policy now that you can use ChatGPT if you cite it as a source. Disgusts me personally but fair enough I guess. In the long run tho; they really are cheating themselves. When they get into a work force; there is no Chegg to do their jobs; and I *promise* you; companies are way less bound by rules and regulations and they have *no* desire to pay a salary to someone who can kind of use ChatGPT and Google. Nor; frankly; do those tools even do a lot of the kind of work fresh grads are tasked with. When the day comes that they need to work for a living they will be totally fucked.",2025-03-08

Even though I do think this school has an antisemitism problem; much of which I highlight in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/s/8d5pikSimF); I don’t trust a thing this administration “discovers”. It’s basically guaranteed they’ll exaggerate and/or misrepresent anything they see as vaguely pro-Palestine to be antisemitic. And like another commenter mentioned; Elon literally did two obvious Nazi salutes on inauguration day. Yeah; I don’t care what the DOJ has to say.
Is this in contradiction with DEI ideology ? Or part of it?
This has “Agent Hitler; FBI” vibes
Completely misleading by OP. The letter says nothing specifically about UCLA; but broadly includes all UC schools. DOJ has not reached any conclusions yet.
Remember the cultural affairs commissioner who refused to hire Jewish students?
What they mean is anti Israel investigation
Good. It's not going to be hard to prove. There's been open and rank antisemitism at my ""alma mater"" since Oct 7th.
They'll find it; regardless of if it exists or how much. The point is to return results that paint the UC system as broken; education as a corrupt industry; and it will fuel more death in Gaza. Babies love to dismantle structures; while adults will painstakingly have to rebuild.

I want to go to med school and I've heard that the customizability of the curriculum and the amazing research opportunities in CCS are great for applying but I know that there aren't many opportunities for clinical experience. Is it still worth it to go and apply for med school? I know I can deal with a typical premed course load and research.
COMMENTS:
Honestly; I will recommend you to consider programs in the MCDB department. The CCS Chem/Biochem program is designed for students who wants to do research and get a PhD after graduation. You may feel that the CCS privileges are cool; but I don’t think they are tailor-made for med school.
CCS is geared toward research and creation of knowledge. I’m a CCS bio major and it specifically says if you’re aiming for pre med; this isn’t the right fit but feel free to apply (my own paraphrasing) CCS is for curious people who want to curate and apply themselves to learning and likely go to grad school for research or crating new works. If you think you fit this description and pre med; you’re in the right place
If you want research to be incorporated into your future medical career as an MD PhD or have your own lab in the future; CCS could give you incredible research chops that would be harder to obtain in a regular degree program. But a few things: 1) since we don’t have a med school; our research is super basic sciencey; very few opportunities for clinical research vs. other UCs with MD programs. So you may need to contend with the fact that your work may not be immediately applicable to medicine. 2) Though the experience could help in making your app more competitive and unique for med school; I’d argue that the investment-to-return ratio is probably not worthwhile; i.e. instead of going all-in on bench research/academia it’s more worth it to do more volunteering that you care about; get cool clinical experiences; or even just studying more and getting a higher MCAT/GPA.",2025-03-08

I’m a bio major at CSU Sac. I’m kinda just wanna hear from other transfers about y’all’s experience. Specific CSU to UC transfers. I’d also have to live on campus as well so how is on campus living? And finally; if I do transfer should I declare a different major because bio is impacted? I’d be interested in anthro or biological anthropology.
COMMENTS:
You can transfer into a different major but you will still need to have the Transfer major requirements completed for what ever major you list on your UC application. Note that CCC to UC Transfers get priority so a CSU to UC Transfer will have less priority. Tips for CSU to UC transfers: 1. Get informed and and make a plan. Use assist to get informed and go out to look for any answers you might have. From ASSIST you will get all the information you need for the prerequisites you need for your major. Look up the major prereqs for every school you are interested in transferring to. When you know all the information for which classes to take; make a plan. Plan out which classes you need to take each semester before you transfer and how you will reach those mandatory 60 semester units needed to transfer to a UC. This is probably the most important part of transferring. The faster you have a plan the faster you get to transfer and you will have a easier and clearer path. And look through all the threads on the website and get a sense of what you need to do and what it takes to get a UC. 2. Don’t lose sight of the goal! Keep up your grades up and take enough classes to stay on track. So when you are striving to get As in those classes and you want to give up; don’t lose sight for what you are doing this for. CSU students probably have to do the most to transfer because the odds are against us. If you are not willing to put in the work and you do not have the heart then trying to transfer is not for you especially if you are a CSU student. If you do put it in the work; trust me it will be worth it. 3. Applications have to be perfect. When you are finally applying to those UCs; make sure they are perfect when you submit them. Call all the schools you are applying; talk to some counselors; going to workshops if you can.. do everything to make sure they are perfect. And for your personal insight questions; start early and and get some expert advice on them. Every CSU has a writing center to my knowledge; go to them with your essays and have them go over it for you and they’ll help you. Talk to counselors because they know what schools are looking for in a good essay and what an applicant should write. 4. Plan for the worst. The truth is that CSU students have lower priority for transferring to UCs right after 1st) CC and 2nd) UC students. Some applicants will not get into the schools they want or might not get into any that they apply to and that is the sad truth. So make a plan for every outcome that is possible. You might go to a UC that you did not expect or you might have to stay where you are now.",2025-03-08

COMMENTS:
If you live off campus your aid will be reduced. I commute to merced and don't pay as I get enough to cover tuition; which is the only thing you are billed for directly. Unless you enroll in insurance or the book program.
To answer your question; you don’t. UC Merced estimates your off campus costs and those estimates are shown as greater than on campus living. Pretty sure the only fees you’ll pay to ucm for off campus is tuition; health care (which you can opt out if you already have); and other smaller fees (student organizations; etc). These are fees every student pays. I’d suggest living off campus if you have a car; a friend with a car; or are willing to take the bus. On campus living can have its benefits such as being able to get to classes quickly and you may make some friends. But off campus living has more benefits; at least for me. Also rent for a a single bedroom in a shared house can range from $900-$500 depending on how nice the room is. On campus last I checked was at minimum $800 per month plus a mandatory meal plan.
If you're paying out of pocket then staying at home and commuting is a no brainer
you can live at home. I’m from Merced and was able to live at home and also heard from people that the school would require that your first year to be an on campus resident but this was not the case. I received most of my expected financial aid. I also have my insurance waived as we have insurance through my dad’s employer. The only thing that was effected was that I was expected to get bobcat grant but they got taken away as I choose to live at home. But yes u can live at home and commute and it didn’t really have an effect as I received most of expected financial aid. Just the bobcat grant got taken away but living at home is very very cheap for me as I only spent maybe 2k and with one scholarship of 1k a semester for two years and I’m in my third year.",2025-03-08

I spoke to my advisor recently; they said no application is needed (new); but to contact financial aid office just to make sure that you qualify for summer aid. https://preview.redd.it/k0u15et3lrme1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c203fa20145f965bae5fd02b5cb7cbf4338ac668
recently had this question as well. last academic year there was a form you had to fill out and go from there but this time around the same website i used for last year had nothing redirecting me to do so. i contacted the students first center and was told that there wasn’t any need for a form. just sign up and should be good with the 2024-2025 financial aid. i’m still going to make sure that’s factual but that’s what i was told recently.
Also summer tuition is per unit so taking 12 units is going to cost more and since there's very little summer aid available to student make sure that just incase he has a way to pay the rest of the tuition in case summer aid doesn't cover it.",2025-03-08

have you done your capstone project yet? the engineering capstone projects are literally just internships since you work with an actual company and actually deploy a real-world solution that the company you'll work with will actually use. you can still look for an internship this summer but i really wouldn't worry about losing hope; especially since the SOE's capstones are designed in a way in which everyone graduates with an internship disguised as a capstone project. you just ask your mentor if you can list your capstone as an internship; usually they'll say it's okay. i actually got my current job because of my experience with the capstone project i did (i graduated in CSE) so i'd really hone in on that if you can't find something this summer.
If all else fails; you can use your degree toward applying to becoming a California licensed Contractor. Start your own business and such.
Look into city govt and state govt jobs! It’s a good way to get your foot thru the door and build experience on ur resume
Don't worry; you've still got time. Make sure your resume and cover letter are top-notch - spend some time polishing them and get cozy with your career services office; those folks can be a goldmine of advice and connections. Just be ready when something interesting comes up!
try to focus on a specific topic of mech e and cater your resume to it . example like Tribology or manufacturing
Many of the engineering jobs are being snapped up by holders of H1-B visas. They work for cheaper and are beholden to the company that sponsors their visa.

I’m pretty sure summer graduation just means you would complete your units in summer but you walk in spring; that’s what my friend did.

Submit your graduation application for summer and once that is done you can go ahead and refill for spring 2025 if you do not need to take courses during the summer.

COMMENTS:
RA 3200 pre tax I think? TA is 3700 pre tax. A master bedroom is about 700 a month; the campus is pretty isolated so your option is to either buy prepaid swipe to eat at school or meal prep.
It’s closer to $2900 research step 1; and ~$3100 TA step 1 post tax. Rent can vary; but if you want a studio apartment it’ll be at least $1000 per month. If you look for roommates then you can probably get your own room for ~$600-900. Campus has 2 dining halls. My opinion; pavilion is the better of the two. People hate on the dining halls; but they are not bad. Sometimes they can get monotonous if you’ve been here long enough since they tend to cycle through the same 20-30 ish meal options.

The state needs to invest in the campus community more. Bring more things for students to do; more places to eat; finish up the edges of campus to look more professional (let's move past the string on a stake look); finish up sidewalks and bike paths; etc. The professors; researchers; and students are doing amazing things out there!

TS;AC - (too scared; afraid to click): UC Merced getting R1 Research Classification Tier “Earning the highly coveted Carnegie R1 benchmark exemplifies UC Merced’s status as a comprehensive research university and our unwavering commitment to discovery; innovation; access and academic excellence”” NICE!!
So now they’ll go from being like most public flagship universities with average or less then average academics that would increase their low GPA out of state admission rates to being a public flagship university that increases their higher GPA out of state admission rates; obviously either type of increase of out of state students (since they pay full price and higher price) comes at the expense of low income instate students who they tell to go to a community college which is cheaper and get some classes out of the way there on the cheap and then transfer to a 4 year university. If only low income students who went that route had the same graduate rates as low income students who went directly to a 4 year university. I know… long kind of unrelated comment; but I’d assume out of state tuition rates will soon be rising as will their numbers since the DOE won’t be around to help out those red state public universities",2025-03-08

Which is giving more financial aid? Do you live nearby either of them currently to save on rent? What’s your priority in life? Do you want to go to grad school? Do you prefer small class sizes? Disclaimer: I graduated in 2012 from UCM when classes were extremely small. Unsure how it is now. Maybe someone can chime in.
I think sjsu is a solid choice considering it's in the heart of Silicon Valley and maybe has better alumni connections and career fairs related to cs. I'd maybe be biased but I'd argue UCM's CSE is pretty solid too. The professors are fantastic; research opportunities are great. I know tons of people who graduated with a CSE degree from UCM and are doing great in the industry just as well as someone from another college would do. In the end the choice is up to you but both are by far solid choice imo.
You can't go wrong with either. Visit both campuses and take route and see for yourself what is the best fit for you
I can't speak to SJSU; but UC Merced has a fantastic CSE department. I would highly recommend the program; especially if you have interest in areas such as AI and robotics.",2025-03-08

While exploring the university website; I found research opportunities primarily for undergraduate students; but I’m unsure if there are options for someone like me—who isn’t currently affiliated with the university. I would love to contribute as a volunteer or in any other capacity. If any faculty members or researchers allow external participants in their labs; or if anyone here can guide me on how to approach this; I would really appreciate your insights. Thank you!

To my understanding usually faculty/professors do research; so you may want to look into teaching a class for the upcoming medical program. PhD students are also able to do research; but I have an idea. Put up some flyers for your place of work around for the professors; one will show up and bam! Ask for a spot.",2025-03-08

I hope you're all doing well. I applied for the PhD program in the MBSE department within the priority deadline (Fall 2025); and waiting for the results is kinda nerve-racking.

COMMENTS:
I've applied in the CIS department. I am an international applicant.
I don’t know if each department has its own specific rules and systems but I’ve applied for masters in CIS (I’m currently an undergrad at Uc Merced and am in a research lab). For that program I know that the grad division releases acceptances for both masters and PhD at the same time. The CIS program is still deliberating on their program size and specifications. If the rest of the programs follow suit; it may just be a matter of them still deciding how they’re structuring their program for Fall ‘25 before they release their acceptances. I wish you all the best of luck!
Mechanical Engineering for Masters I got my acceptance in like July lol. By that point I completely forgot I applied and thought I was denied without a follow up email.
Hey! glad to see a post like this because i'm also curious to hear how others admissions processes are going. I applied for their QSB program and heard back from the dept with an offer like early this week. i think it depends per department because of the people we interviewed with and the dept their in. if you feel like you felt good (or decent) after the interviews and got an invitation to the in person visit day; i think it's a good sign. hang in there 🙏 :)

I missed the application deadline for UCM and will be going to CC for 3 years. I’m pretty confident i’ll get in. I’d be applying CS. If i got in; is it possible to complete the degree in 1 year? Has anybody heard of this? I’d prefer to only spend 4 years in undergrad which is why im asking. Thanks!
COMMENTS:
Depends on major but also probably not because I don’t think community college classes fulfill upper division requirements.
Depends what your major is and how many upper divs you will need to complete here.
Look at the 4 year plan for the major to determine how many more units you need to complete for the major after transferring. Since only 70 semester units will be accepted for transfer; you are looking around 50 semester units required to complete the degree. 1 year is pretty optimistic. https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/content.php?catoid=23&navoid=2508
I think it's somewhat possible. However; it depends on your major; which courses are transfered; and how much pressure you can handle. I transfered to UC Merced in Fall 2024 (CSE); and my plan is to graduate in Fall 2025. I haven't tried my best yet. I can definitely rush even more by taking more courses each semester and taking classes in the Summer too; but I didn't. The best recommendation is to talk to UC Merced advisors. They have met many students like you already for sure.
Something to keep in mind: “[Limitations on Transfer Credits](https://admissions.ucmerced.edu/sites/admissions.ucmerced.edu/files/documents/ucop-handout_transfer_credit_practice.pdf) Students will be awarded up to 70 semester/105 quarter units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any institution or any combination of institutions. Subject credit only will be awarded for appropriate coursework taken in excess of this unit limitation and may be used to meet requirements. • Units earned through: AP; IB; and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation and do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission. • Units earned at any UC campus (Extension; summer; cross/concurrent and regular academic year enrollment) are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed and may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units. • Note: if all courses are completed at one or more 2-year (community) colleges; a student would never be in danger of having too many (excessive) units.”
It is possible; just beware of the residency requirements at UCM (my friend spent 1 yr here but she had to take classes in the summer after she graduated bc she didn’t meet the residency requirement). It’s also sort of complicated depending on what units transfer over; which ones don’t; and your petitions. Speaking from transfer student experience!
Probably not because ccc classes ain’t upper divisions also the uc has a unit cap of 70 semester unit from ccc and the rest have to be done at a uc",2025-03-08

Wouldn't this be easier to update (with no character limit either!) via a Google Sheets doc? Nice idea though.
Idk why everyone is shitting on Larsen for Ochem 12B; she was an amazing teacher who taught everything in the most basic terms; and had some easy exams. The final wasn't even that difficult neither if you just studied the material. Yall need to put some respect on her name.
You should post this to the UCR Class Facebook groups for people to fill out.
For bio 005 avoid maduro and for biochem 100 avoid larsen
Does anyone remember the readings or have a copy of the syllabus for RLST127? I still think about that class...6 years later lol

COMMENTS:
Your gpa won’t matter once your transfer. The school like it best when you transfer with almost all your lower division classes done. I got an F in calculus in CC and I got into all the schools I applied too. And that F took a hit to my gpa heavily. You’ll be okay
I got accepted with a 3.2
It depends on your major I got into public policy with a 2.8; but you can’t get into an impacted major with a sub 3 gpa
i got into history with a 3.5; so its not exactly an answer to your question; but it does depend on major
Why didn't you just tag; the requirement for CHASS is only 2.8.
All depends on your major. If you are trying to get into Computer Science; Psychology; or BIO then you need a high GPA.

I like being social during the day; but not when it comes to my sleep lol.
COMMENTS:
Not Pentland. Dundee may be the best for your needs.
Currently in East Lothian; and I’d say it’s pretty quiet most of the time. Although I would probably advise getting a floor higher up; as the music rooms and the main lounge are on the 1st floor.
Its basically a lottery but dundee is your best pick.
Dundee is certainly the most quiet one; the LLC halls usually are quiet too (eastlo)
I was in Pentland last year - it's a gamble because you are gonna be in a suite situation. Either you get a lively group like I did; or you have an absolutely dead suite of people that don't talk to each other. From what I saw its 50/50; but I was in the honors building. You do get a more private bathroom/shower situation in Pentland because those are shared only among your suite; while the other dorms (Dundee; AI; Lothian) will have communal bathrooms/showers for the whole floor.
Dundee is pretty quiet. The room doors close on their own so everyone just has their doors closed and don't talk to each other",2025-03-08

Thinking of just using the $$ I get to live somewhere like Newport that is just more a vibe and commute daily. I saw some people commute from sd so it feels pretty manageable. Used to go to Occ so pretty familiar with the area. Thoughts and opinions ?
COMMENTS:
Commute will suck. 1 hr with no traffic; 3 with traffic. I've done it it sucks I'll rather like in riverside which also sucks but at least it won't give you back pain from driving 10 hours a week
Financial aid decreases when you move from on campus to off campus; so keep that in mind.
I grew up in OC; went to k-12 in Newport. Not worth it. Everyone there is stuck up and rude; no one knows their neighbors or anything. The beach is pretty but isn’t worth the people; price or the overall lack of community. Here in Riverside; I know all my neighbors and everyone is really welcoming. I grew up in the same house for 19 years and only knew 1 neighbor in the entire neighborhood then they moved.
I mean sure if you're okay with the commute. That's the trade off right? I drove every day from in the IE and that shit was ass. Don't know how someone who lives by the beach could handle it but you do you. I think the difficult part is going to be finding affordable home near the beach let alone a good area.
Hi; I am from Newport. The people are nice enough; and the city is better designed than most cities in the US; but… No lol. It's a one hour commute. Newport is not good enough to drain 2 hours from you every time you have a block of classes in a day.
My opinion; the OC is a cesspit. But do what makes you happy.
Riverside sucks ass and I'd rather drive hours than live in it but not for newport. Also; my friend commutes from SD and it is not manageable; they just hate Riverside so much they'd rather suffer in almost 5 hours of traffic per commute. Maybe live in LA or look into another coastal city.
The only way this can work without going insane is making an airtight schedule that requires you to be on campus no more than 3 days a week.
I have all my tuition covered and I still get 2;700 leftover however I do not like living in riverside so I commute from an hour and tbh it is manageable just take morning classes(so u can avoid traffic) and stack all of em onto two days.
The beach cities suck and are crazy racist. There’s some nice areas of Riverside/the IE (Canyon Crest; Rancho; Redlands). Anything outside of Riverside is gonna have a really tough commute; though!",2025-03-08

How affordable was your education? How much did you pay out of pocket; and how much was covered? Did you have to take out any loans? 13.) How good would you say this program is for someone who is interested in web development. 14.) Do you know if there are art/graphic design minors on campus?

Is it still worth it to go and apply for med school? I know I can deal with a typical premed course load and research.
COMMENTS:
Honestly; I will recommend you to consider programs in the MCDB department. The CCS Chem/Biochem program is designed for students who wants to do research and get a PhD after graduation. You may feel that the CCS privileges are cool; but I don’t think they are tailor-made for med school.
CCS is geared toward research and creation of knowledge. I’m a CCS bio major and it specifically says if you’re aiming for pre med; this isn’t the right fit but feel free to apply (my own paraphrasing) CCS is for curious people who want to curate and apply themselves to learning and likely go to grad school for research or crating new works. If you think you fit this description and pre med; you’re in the right place
If you want research to be incorporated into your future medical career as an MD PhD or have your own lab in the future; CCS could give you incredible research chops that would be harder to obtain in a regular degree program. But a few things: 1) since we don’t have a med school; our research is super basic sciencey; very few opportunities for clinical research vs. other UCs with MD programs. So you may need to contend with the fact that your work may not be immediately applicable to medicine. 2) Though the experience could help in making your app more competitive and unique for med school; I’d argue that the investment-to-return ratio is probably not worthwhile; i.e. instead of going all-in on bench research/academia it’s more worth it to do more volunteering that you care about; get cool clinical experiences; or even just studying more and getting a higher MCAT/GPA.",2025-03-08

I’m a bio major at CSU Sac. I’m kinda just wanna hear from other transfers about y’all’s experience. Specific CSU to UC transfers. I’d also have to live on campus as well so how is on campus living? And finally; if I do transfer should I declare a different major because bio is impacted? I’d be interested in anthro or biological anthropology.
COMMENTS:
You can transfer into a different major but you will still need to have the Transfer major requirements completed for what ever major you list on your UC application. Note that CCC to UC Transfers get priority so a CSU to UC Transfer will have less priority. Tips for CSU to UC transfers: 1. Get informed and and make a plan. Use assist to get informed and go out to look for any answers you might have. From ASSIST you will get all the information you need for the prerequisites you need for your major. Look up the major prereqs for every school you are interested in transferring to. When you know all the information for which classes to take; make a plan. Plan out which classes you need to take each semester before you transfer and how you will reach those mandatory 60 semester units needed to transfer to a UC. This is probably the most important part of transferring. The faster you have a plan the faster you get to transfer and you will have a easier and clearer path. And look through all the threads on the website and get a sense of what you need to do and what it takes to get a UC. 2. Don’t lose sight of the goal! Keep up your grades up and take enough classes to stay on track. So when you are striving to get As in those classes and you want to give up; don’t lose sight for what you are doing this for. CSU students probably have to do the most to transfer because the odds are against us. If you are not willing to put in the work and you do not have the heart then trying to transfer is not for you especially if you are a CSU student. If you do put it in the work; trust me it will be worth it. 3. Applications have to be perfect. When you are finally applying to those UCs; make sure they are perfect when you submit them. Call all the schools you are applying; talk to some counselors; going to workshops if you can.. do everything to make sure they are perfect. And for your personal insight questions; start early and and get some expert advice on them. Every CSU has a writing center to my knowledge; go to them with your essays and have them go over it for you and they’ll help you. Talk to counselors because they know what schools are looking for in a good essay and what an applicant should write. 4. Plan for the worst. The truth is that CSU students have lower priority for transferring to UCs right after 1st) CC and 2nd) UC students. Some applicants will not get into the schools they want or might not get into any that they apply to and that is the sad truth. So make a plan for every outcome that is possible. You might go to a UC that you did not expect or you might have to stay where you are now.",2025-03-08

This is based on [poll results](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1ib38p3/poll_to_ban_x_fb_ig_andor_tiktok_links/) that showed an overwhelming consensus to at least ban X links; but mixed opinions on whether to ban links to other social media websites. Thus; for now; the rule will only extend to X/Twitter. The mods also recognize the potential for news and emergency information to be shared over social media. In an effort to keep that flow of information and avoid censorship; screenshots of X posts/tweets will continue to be allowed as top-level posts on this sub. You'll also notice that the rule as currently written is silent on comments linking to X/Twitter. Because there isn't as simple of a replacement for comment links as there is for posts (screenshots); the rule we are trialing will not extend to comments. Thus; a comment containing an X link is theoretically allowed -- however; it still must follow sub rules and sitewide expectations; including those regarding relevance; spam; and ant-harassment. Further; using comments as a method to circumvent this and other sub rules will not be tolerated. Ongoing discussion is still welcome and the mods will be reviewing this rule in the coming months; including the screenshot and comment exemptions and sub interest in extending it to other social media sites. Also; as a reminder; this sub is community-run and moderated and this rule change was made entirely without the involvement or consultation of the university that shares a name with it. If you have questions or concerns about this rule; bring it up either in the subreddit or directly to the moderators.
COMMENTS:
Can we get a new rule that encourages more pics of cheeto?
On a personal note; I also want to say I was encouraged by the swift and overwhelming rejection of hate and authoritarianism displayed by the subreddit users in the past few weeks. Glad to continue sharing a subreddit with y'all!
But looking at the poll you linked; banning x was only the third most popular option (behind don’t ban and ban all social media) Also the participants are a small subset of those in this sub
The vote started with banning all social media → then banning none → then banning only Twitter. Ignoring the community’s own choices and settling on a decision that clearly aligns with the moderators' personal bias doesn’t seem fair. Silencing people who disagree isn’t how you convince them of a ‘better’ ideology—it’s just self-segregation. If the goal is actually to change minds; shutting down discussion isn’t the way to do it. Even our own community didn’t vote for this.
This is a form of censorship. Also being able to post only screen shots may actually cause more harm than good because things can be taken out of context or further altered.
Weird and bad take; if there is a relevant discussion on twitter; let people see the discussion.
Not looking at Twitter doesn't make Twitter go away. A college sub reddit limiting information? Sounds a little sad. I hope your feelings are ok. I'm constantly amused by the reactionary and intolerant views posted here.
Congrats on keeping that echo chamber going

CSUs and Calpolys may be the way to go.
All about community college. I don't know about the EE major; but if there's a TAG for it; you can get some great small-classroom experiences; and you'll have a lot more money in your pocket to make your time after transferring comfortable. But I also understand wanting a full 4-year experience; sounds like you put the work in and should've been recognized for it. Best of luck; you'll succeed wherever you go.
Engineering moment. If you applied for any non-impacted major you would have def gotten in
Seems like nowadays that isn’t enough. My boyfriend went through the same thing right out of high school. If it’s an option; opt for community college and transfer later on. You’ll save a lotta money. Good luck 👍🏼
u from the bay? those kids are held up to a much higher standard
Not getting into colleges absolutely does not mean that you didn’t do enough in high school. The college acceptance system just sucks because no one really knows the exact criteria. It sorta feels like luck along with grades/extra-circulars; etc",2025-03-08

You’ll most likely hear back if you’re accepted or not around June if you’re on the waitlist
Mid May to Mid June-ish. Acceptances from the waitlist typically come out in waves and depends on the major. If you hear others getting acceptances from the same major; you should check your portal/email.
I was also waitlisted as a CS major; 4.2 weighted 3.9 unweighted; not many extracurriculars either. I was om the waitlist up until the last wave of acceptances on July 2nd. Wishing you luck!

These are exactly the same folks that fight all housing in Santa Cruz; making it so that students; staff; and faculty can never find housing; and what they do find is super expensive; that make it cost $1250 to rent a Home Depot tool shed in somebody's backyard. These phonies are hyper conservative and just want to keep out new people from Santa Cruz at all costs; adopting whatever veneer of external politics that best attracts those that aren't paying attention to what's going on. Look at some basic class analysis and you'll see that the only class that benefits from their actions are landlords; despite them labelling themselves as tenants. Edit; Marx never quite finished chapter 52 of volume 3 of capital; and there's been a ton of more recent thought on the matter as one would expect from an old dead guy; but the land-owner class analysis is *crucial* for understanding Santa Cruz; and groups like this only work to prop up and support the landlord class. Read the unfinished chapter here: https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch52.htm
I've wondered for awhile why University students haven't organized around housing. There are plenty of unions representing academic and other university employees but none representing campus tenants that I know of. It seems a lot of these strikes by the unions have centered around compensaiton not meeting the cost of housing. The price of living on campus is awfully inflated and the university has a larger effect on the housing market in town than any other landlord. It only seems natural to organize a campus tenants union. A rent strike would be far more impactful way of improving lives of the students and the community than another labor stike would.
Managed by a bunch of useless parasites.
Very important!!
Tenant rights are important! Public process is important! This project privatizes the childcare! It cuts the number of housing available to students with families on campus! It’s also wildly expensive and wrecks the campus gateway. But who cares about quality for students anyway; right?",2025-03-08

Specifically; I'm curious to know: 1.) What is your overall opinion of your education overall? 2.) How challenging is it to get into the Computer Science program as a community college transfer? 3.) Was the program more focused on theory or hands-on application (i.e.; did you spend more time coding and creating programs; or learning theoretical concepts)? 4.) How rigorous and challenging was the course load? Was it relatively easy to manage? 5.) What are you currently doing now; and did your major help you secure that position? 6.) Would you recommend the program to others? 7.) What unique job and internship opportunities did you find through your school; if any? 8.) How was your experience with computer science electives on campus? 9.) Are there any tech/computer science related clubs/extracurricular activities on campus? 10.) Did you make any projects in your classes and if so what type of projects did you make? 11.) What were your fellow computer science majors like on campus? What was the general culture in those environments? Were people competitive or helpful/supportive of each other? 12.) Were the class sizes generally small or large? 13.) How affordable was your education? How much did you pay out of pocket; and how much was covered? Did you have to take out any loans? 14.) How good would you say this program is for someone who is interested in web development. 15.) Do you know if there are art/graphic design minors on campus? Feel free to answer just one or two of these questions if that’s easier for you. **I would greatly appreciate it if you could at least try to answer the question about where you currently are in relation to your career**; but it's not required. I'm looking to learn more about different programs as I make my decision on which school to attend. Thank you!
COMMENTS:
1.) I am satisfied. Its definitely what you make of it. Are you going to take the hard classes where you will learn useful things; or will you pick the easiest classes because you just need to graduate and can't risk losing any more gpa. 3.) I would say that most of the classes are theoretical aka just not coding: Low div coding: CSE 20; 30; 40(i think but havent taken it); 13s Upper Div Coding: CSE 101; 130; 114a; 115a ^^^(these are just the major required classes obv) here is the catalog: [https://catalog.ucsc.edu/en/current/general-catalog/academic-units/baskin-engineering/computer-science-and-engineering/computer-science-bs/](https://catalog.ucsc.edu/en/current/general-catalog/academic-units/baskin-engineering/computer-science-and-engineering/computer-science-bs/) 4.) Depends on the class. There are easy quarters and there are quarters where you won't have much time. On average; its do able. Although I having a part time job with some of these classes would be pretty brutal. 6.) I mean yes; but comp sci is not as guaranteed as it was in the past. So as a transfer; i think you will love the campus and some of classes are cloned from davis/san diego/ other uc's. I think its a solid program overall; but for me I really like low level stuff like programming in C. 7.) This summer I am doing an internship abroad in japan through ucdavis (unpaid though; actually they make you pay for housing :I and program fees). Also was able to be a tutor for CS classes during some quarters here. 10.) CSE 111; you make a emulator w C++ CSE 130 you make a multithreaded http server in C that can handle get and put requests for text files. CSE 114a you make a nano intepreter in Haskell(functional programming language). Just a basic calculator but it also saves states and can recurse which is pretty cool CSE 186: at the end of it you make a slack clone(discord without vc channels) These are just the classes that i have taken so far. 11.) 20% of majors at ucsc are comp sci. Chances are; you will find a group of friends taking the same classes as you. 12.) For the major required classes; typically 100-200 people. Some upper div elective are pretty small. Right now I am about to take embedded operating systems with 50 people in it. 14.) They have a web development series that a lot of people love(CSE186 and 187). Tough assignments that teach you a lot. Taking 186 right now and the last project is to create a Slack clone(we have 2 weeks). This school isn't the most friendly to web development as in; you wont touch any of it until your high div electives. Until then you will just be coding in C or python(if AI). They also have CSE 115a which puts people into 4-5ish person groups. You use scrum practices and create an app over 10 weeks; although they only teach the scrum practices in class. Everything program wise in that class is self study. I would say if you have any web development knowledge you can definitely show it off in that class and create a impressive project for the resume.",2025-03-08

Which UC’s do you plan to apply for transfer? You need to try and match the UCSC courses to the required transfer courses for each campus you plan to apply. Since the UC’s do not have course articulation agreements between each other; you can use assist.org; look up the courses at a local CC that are required for the other UC campuses and then match those CCC courses to the UCSC courses. If you complete all your lower division GE’s at UCSC; you can get the Reciprocity letter which will fulfill the lower division GE requirements at all the other UC’s.

Davis. They have better cog sci.
UC Davis has a better rated Cognitive science program and more course options based on your focus.

COMMENTS:
Tips for CSU to UC transfers: 1. Get informed and and make a plan. Use assist to get informed and go out to look for any answers you might have. From ASSIST you will get all the information you need for the prerequisites you need for your major. Look up the major prereqs for every school you are interested in transferring to. When you know all the information for which classes to take; make a plan. Plan out which classes you need to take each semester before you transfer and how you will reach those mandatory 60 semester units needed to transfer to a UC. This is probably the most important part of transferring. The faster you have a plan the faster you get to transfer and you will have a easier and clearer path. And look through all the threads on the website and get a sense of what you need to do and what it takes to get a UC. 2. Don’t lose sight of the goal! Keep up your grades up and take enough classes to stay on track. So when you are striving to get As in those classes and you want to give up; don’t lose sight for what you are doing this for. CSU students probably have to do the most to transfer because the odds are against us. If you are not willing to put in the work and you do not have the heart then trying to transfer is not for you especially if you are a CSU student. If you do put it in the work; trust me it will be worth it. 3. Applications have to be perfect. When you are finally applying to those UCs; make sure they are perfect when you submit them. Call all the schools you are applying; talk to some counselors; going to workshops if you can.. do everything to make sure they are perfect. And for your personal insight questions; start early and and get some expert advice on them. Every CSU has a writing center to my knowledge; go to them with your essays and have them go over it for you and they’ll help you. Talk to counselors because they know what schools are looking for in a good essay and what an applicant should write. 4. Plan for the worst. The truth is that CSU students have lower priority for transferring to UCs right after 1st) CC and 2nd)UC students. Some applicants will not get into the schools the want or might not get into any that they apply to and that is the sad truth. So make a plan for every outcome that is possible. You might go to a UC that you did not expect or you might have to stay where you are now.",2025-03-08

The legislation pledges to deliver by 2022 what would be the largest single-year infusion of state funds to increase California student enrollment at UC campuses. The proposal comes after the university system was inundated by a record number of applications for fall 2021 in a year of high emotion and myriad questions over the admissions process and frustration over the lack of seats for qualified students. The state would provide enough funding to reimburse the campuses for the loss of nonresident supplemental tuition; which amounts to nearly 30;000 per student and 1.3 billion collectively each year. The higher education spending numbers were included in an amended budget bill posted online Friday before Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic leaders reached an agreement later in the night on the 262.6-billion state budget. Another document summarizing the points of their agreement includes what legislative leaders say is the largest expansion of Cal Grant financial aid to date. The summary noted that the figures were preliminary and that details in both documents could change before legislators vote on the bill next week. Under the proposed budget bill; the state would pay UC to reduce nonresidents at the systems three most sought-after campuses; from more than 22 of undergraduates to 18; over five years beginning in fall 2022. That would make room for about 4;500 additional California students over that period. In addition to the 900 seats freed up each year by lowering the share of nonresident students at UCLA; UC Berkeley and UC San Diego; the state would provide funds to enroll the additional California freshmen in fall 2022; with President Michael V. Drake and the nine undergraduate campuses to decide how to split the money. California State University would receive funds to add 9;434 more freshman seats over the previous year in fall 2022. The state would provide 180 million to cover the UC and Cal State enrollment expansion. Newsom and Democratic legislators also agreed to create a new 2-billion fund to expand UC and Cal State facilities to accommodate more students and provide more student housing for the two systems; along with the California Community Colleges. And the state would provide 154 million so that the main Cal Grant can be given to 133;000 community college students this fall who would not otherwise have qualified under rules that favor those who enroll within a year of graduating high school. The bill would eliminate that restriction; broadening access to older students. Also; for the first time the state would provide an extra 515 million to recipients of middle-class scholarships to help cover some nontuition costs such as housing and food. Legislators say the actions mark the first step in a longer-term plan to enable California students to finish college without debt. The proposed expansion comes at a critical time for hundreds of thousands of California students struggling under college costs; surging student loan debt and increased financial hardship triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a transformational budget; said Assemblyman Kevin McCarty (D-Sacramento); who heads the Assembly subcommittee on education finance. We will be funding the largest expansion of higher education access in a generation. The Friday budget bill includes 4.6 billion for UC; including 175 million for deferred maintenance and energy efficiency projects; 20 million for student mental health; 15 million for basic needs; 22.5 million for academic preparation programs; 15 million for emergency financial assistance for low-income students and 4 million for summer financial aid. Programs to train medical professionals for underserved areas; legal services for immigrant students and research into firearms violence and dyslexia would also receive funding. The 23-campus Cal State system would receive 5.2 billion; including 458 million to transition Humboldt State to a polytechnic campus focused on science; technology; engineering and math. Cal State Northridge would receive 25 million to create a center to increase equity in science; technology and math. An additional 325 million would be funneled to the state universities for deferred maintenance and energy efficiency projects; 30 million for emergency financial aid for low-income students and 15 million for student basic needs. Although the amended budget bill did not specify the base funding increase for UC and Cal State; it amounted to 5 in Newsoms revised May proposal. But the move to significantly reduce out-of-state and international UC students tackles an issue that has long drawn heat from Californians and has sparked furious debate over who should get a coveted seat in the nations premier public research university system. The issue has prompted a scathing state audit; UC admission reforms and extensive policy work around ways to accommodate the growing number of qualified California applicants amid limited funding and space. Its a punch one and punch two  people apply with phenomenal grades and they dont get in; and then they realize the person that got their slot is an out-of-state student; McCarty said. Its infuriating for California taxpayers. UC chancellors; however; have a different view. Nonresident students are enrolled only in addition to; and never in place of; qualified California students; said UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla. As state funding declined; the enrollment of nonresident students helped offset tuition costs for California students and provided revenue that enabled us to improve educational programs for all students. He said nonresident student tuition helps recruit and retain high-quality faculty members; launch additional courses that help lower class size; increase library collections; renew instructional equipment and contribute to financial aid for Californians. UC campus leaders say theyre gratified that the state will compensate their campuses for the loss of nonresident revenue. Shane White; UCLAs Academic Senate chair; called it a step in the right direction but added that the fundamental issues over nonresident students have yet to be analyzed  including why the systemwide cap on them was set at 18 in 2017. UC regents allowed UCLA; San Diego; Berkeley and Irvine to grandfather in their higher shares. UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ said an important reality check is that the current state allocation for each California student doesnt cover the actual cost of instruction; a gap filled by nonresident tuition. Replacing out-of-state students with Californians thus creates a budget gap that needs to be filled; Christ said. Even more important; out-of-state and international students contribute significantly to the diversity of the student experience; and the majority of these students remain in California after they graduate. The state provides 10;886 per student to cover its share of the cost of instruction; a calculation that includes faculty salary and benefits; teaching assistant time; instructional equipment; academic support and student services. But that figure falls about 6;000 short of covering the actual cost per student at Berkeley; according to UC data. So some campus leaders are nervous about the specter of losing nonresident students and the financial safety net of their tuition revenue. Still; the plan included in the budget legislation is significantly scaled down from a state Senate proposal unveiled last month to reduce the proportion of nonresident incoming freshmen to 10 from the current systemwide average of 19 over the next decade beginning in 2022. Legislators said at the time that the states record 75-billion surplus provided a rare and opportune moment for bold action to radically open up UC access  especially at its most competitive campuses. Assemblyman Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) said that limited resources led legislators to shelve the larger plan for now and focus on the three most popular campuses but that more action was possible down the road. We still want to get to 10; but it makes sense as a first step to focus on those three campuses; he said. UC officials say they share the goal of enrolling and graduating more California students and have added 19;000 more California undergraduates since 2015. They opposed the 10 plan; however. We understand and support the Legislatures goal of providing more opportunities for Californians at UC; though we believe trying to achieve this through reducing nonresident students will potentially lead to unanticipated outcomes; the university system said in a statement.,2021-06-26

Dianne Feinsteins wealthy investment banker husband used his influence to help an underqualified student get into the University of California; Berkeley; according to a new report. Richard Blum; a UC alum and regent since 2002; penned a letter to the school chancellors office on behalf of the unnamed student; who was waitlisted and had just a 26 percent chance of getting into the prestigious university; the San Jose Mercury News reported Thursday. Blums letter was forwarded to UCs admissions office; which prioritized the students application over more qualified applicants; the outlet said. It is therefore likely that the applicant whom the regent recommended would have been on a list that received priority admission from the waitlist; an audit of Cals admissions practices released Tuesday said. Given the low likelihood of this applicants admission and the prominent and influential role that regents have within the university; we conclude that the decision to admit this applicant was likely influenced by the regents advocacy. The audit did not identify the regent by name; but university spokeswoman Margarita Fernandez confirmed to the Mercury News it was Blum. Reached by phone by the paper; Blum said hes written letters of recommendation for years; and never thought they ever had much influence. This is the first time Ive heard that maybe I did something that wasnt right; he said. I think its a bunch of nonsense. The UC audit found that the school considered inappropriate factors in admitting 64 applicants over more qualified students. Twenty-two got in with beefed-up athletic resumes; while 42 relied on ties to wealthy and influential donors and staffers. The majority of the students were white and at least half came from families with annual incomes of 150;000 and above; the audit said. The review comes on the heels of the unrelated; massive college admissions bribery scandal that ensnared the California university. Among the parents busted in the scams were Full House actress Lori Loughlin and Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman.,2020-09-24

Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.); wrote an inappropriate letter to get an applicant into UC Berkeley; the latest development in a college admissions scandal that exposed how the wealthy and connected get into elite colleges. Blum is a member of the Board of Regents; the governing body of the University of California system; which includes schools like UCLA; UC Berkeley; UC Davis; UC San Diego and UC Irvine. According to a state audit released this week; a regent; later identified as Blum; wrote a letter to UC Berkeleys chancellor advocating for a student on the waitlist; which likely influenced the decision to eventually admit the applicant; who only had a 26 of being admitted based on their application ratings. Blums letter violated university policy; which says regents should only submit letters of recommendations through the regular admissions process; not directly to other parties like the chancellor. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle; Blum said he frequently writes letters bypassing the proper admissions process for friends and family. No one ever told me it was wrong; he said. Blum founded the San Francisco-based investment firm Blum Capital Partners; which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes. Feinsteins office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. My cousins brother wanted to get into Davis. Theyd send me a letter and tell me why its a good kid; and Ill send it on to the chancellor. Been doing it forever; Blum told the San Francisco Chronicle. ...Im not convinced Ive done anything wrong. It all sounds kinda boring to me. The state audit released Tuesday found the UC system unfairly admitted 64 students based on personal connections from 2013 to 2019. The audit was launched in response to the Varsity Blues College Admissions Scandal where prosecutors so far have charged 53 people for participating in a wide-ranging scheme to get students; usually the offspring of wealthy or connected families; into elite colleges using various forms of cheating and bribery.

This is a significant problem that the university needs to deal with; State Auditor Elaine Howle said in a telephone interview. The audit examined admissions policies and practices over a six-year period at four of the UCs nine campuses  UCLA; UC Berkeley; UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara. It reviewed the academic years of 2013-14 through 2018-19. Auditors found that 22 applicants were falsely designated as student-athlete recruits because of donations from or as favours to well-connected families. These students had little or no athletic skills; Howle said. UC Berkeley really had some significant weaknesses in their admissions process; Howle said. The audit found that the elite school admitted 42 applicants based on their connections to donors and staff while denying admission to others who were more qualified. Howle said she believes the findings have barely scratched the surface of problems in the UC admissions process. The 64 students identified as being improperly admitted were based on definitive evidence; such as emailed communications showing a student was denied admission but then reconsidered and accepted after an athletic coach or the development office got involved to suggest the students entry could lead to donations; Howle said. Theres at least another 400 or so students...that were really questionable; Howle said; including some student athletes who didnt appear to have any athletic ability. UC President Michael V Drake; who took over the job in July; said in a statement that he took the findings and recommendations very seriously and will do all I can to prevent inappropriate admissions. The University will swiftly address the concerns the State Auditor raised. Furthermore; individuals involved in improper activities will be disciplined appropriately; Drake said. The audit recommends that the UC Presidents office take a more robust role in auditing the admissions processes at the nine campuses and closely examine what is called admissions by exception; granted for student athletes; artists; or those who have other specific talents that are attractive to a campus. We think that the Office of the President and their audit function should be not only looking deeper at these four campuses but looking at all of the campuses in the UC system; Howle said. The audit was requested last year by state Assemblywoman Tasha Boerner Horvath in response to the national college admissions scandal; which embroiled prestigious universities across the country; athletic coaches and dozens of wealthy parents. The scandal shed light on the murky world of US college admissions and how the rich and famous exploited it to buy their childrens way into top schools with rigged test scores or fake athletic credentials. At the centre of the scheme was Newport Beach-based college admissions consultant; William Rick Singer. Those investigations; known as Operation Varsity Blues; previously identified at least three students at UCLA and UC Berkeley who were improperly admitted. UCLA mens soccer coach Jorge Salcedo was indicted on charges of racketeering conspiracy for allegedly accepting 200;000 in bribes from the schemes mastermind; Rick Singer; in exchange for helping two students gain admission to the school as soccer players; though they didnt play the sport competitively. Salcedo pleaded guilty to one count and is expected to be sentenced next month. At UC Berkeley; at least one student was known to have been admitted with fraudulent test scores; prosecutors allege. David Sidoo; a Canadian businessman and former professional football player; pleaded guilty to one charge of mail fraud conspiracy for paying Singer to fix entrance exams for his two sons. The younger of the two; Jordan Sidoo; attended UC Berkeley. David Sidoo was sentenced to three months in prison this summer. Lawmakers approved the audit of the UCs admissions policies and practices; including efforts to detect and address fraud in the admissions process. Then-UC President Janet Napolitano ordered an internal investigation of all UC campuses that resulted in a sweeping list of recommendations aimed at better policing of fraud and conflicts of interest in student admissions. It called for stronger verification of claims on students applications; reviewing potential links between donors and applicants and stricter scrutiny of students admitted for special talents; such as athletes and artists. Howle found that staff were insufficiently trained and supervised in reviewing applications; which led to inconsistent reviews; and affected applicants chances of admission. The Office of the President has allowed weaknesses to persist for years and has not ensured the admissions policies and processes have been consistently and fairly applied from campus to campus; the audit said; and the presidents office does not monitor or review admission practices across campuses. She also recommended that the president require campuses to verify athletic talent and review donation records before admitting prospective student athletes..

But overall; just a handful of students actually gained admission to California universities as part of Varsity Blues.Tuesdays audit of the UC system found many more; including 22 students who were admitted through the athletic admissions process even though they possessed little athletic talent.Thirteen of those admissions occurred at UC Berkeley; which was not implicated in the earlier scandal.

Those changes include preventing any individual person  the admissions director included  from determining the final outcome of a student application. Under UC policy; donor ties are not supposed to be considered in admissions; and communication between development staff and admissions staff are prohibited during the application review process. But the audit found that at UCLA; development staff and athletic coaches admitted an applicant based on a connection to a significant donor after the applicant was initially denied entry through the regular admissions process. Following the Varsity Blues scandal; UCLA said it created safeguards to prevent a repeat of that type of situation. The incident cited in Tuesdays audit occurred prior to those safeguards being implemented; according to a school spokesperson. Rahmani; the former prosecutor; was skeptical the U.S. Attorneys Office would get involved in the transgressions cited in the audit. Unlike Varsity Blues; which featured bribes to coaches; the payments at UC took the form of donations to the schools. Nor is there any sign of cheating on SATs and ACTs. Id be surprised if it became a criminal case unless theres something we dont know about; like bribes or cheating; Rahmani said. And federal prosecutors might not view the inappropriate admissions as worthy of their time given the precedent for light sentences established in the Varsity Blues scandal; Rahmani said. Actress Lori Loughlin and her husband; Mossimo Giannulli; received just two and five months in prison; respectively; despite paying 500;000 in the admissions scheme. The audit; which refers to the individuals involved only with generic titles like donor and assistant coach; cautions that the 22 inappropriate athletic admissions identified are likely just a fraction of the true total. The auditors office said it did not name those involved to protect student privacy. In a statement; new UC President Michael Drake said he takes the audit findings seriously and has zero tolerance for such behavior. The university will swiftly address the concerns the state auditor raised. Furthermore; individuals involved in improper activities will be disciplined appropriately; Drake said. Our entire organization is committed to a level playing field for every applicant. Unethical means to gain admission; as rare as they may be; run contrary to our longstanding values of equity and fairness. Drake said UC will review the audit findings; coordinate with campuses and map out next steps in the coming weeks. The audit recommends that by next school year; campuses verify applicants athletic talents and review donation records before admitting prospective student athletes. It also suggests that the UC Office of the President oversee UC Berkeleys admissions process for three admissions cycles to ensure that the campus provides a merit-based admissions process that is free of improper influence.,2020-09-22
