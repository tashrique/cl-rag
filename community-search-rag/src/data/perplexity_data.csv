UC Berkeley,Standardized Test Policies,"UC Berkeley no longer considers SAT or ACT scores in undergraduate admissions. Prior to 2020 SAT/ACT scores were required for freshmen but the UC Board of Regents voted in May 2020 to suspend and phase out standardized tests [oai_citation_attribution:10‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20California%20Board,testing%20requirement%20for%20California%20students).

These changes were largely prompted by concerns of equity and the COVID-19 pandemic and UC's elimination of the exam requirement was finalized in 2020 [oai_citation_attribution:14‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/preparing-freshman-students/freshman-requirements.html#:~:text=UC%20eliminated%20its%20standardized%20test,requirement%20in%202020).",2020,UC Board of Regents (May 2020) [oai_citation_attribution:15‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20California%20Board,testing%20requirement%20for%20California%20students); UC Berkeley Admissions (test-free policy) [oai_citation_attribution:16‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshman-policy-changes/#:~:text=Standardized%20testing); UC Admissions site [oai_citation_attribution:17‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/preparing-freshman-students/freshman-requirements.html#:~:text=UC%20eliminated%20its%20standardized%20test,requirement%20in%202020)
UC Berkeley,Essay Expectations,"Berkeley uses the UC Personal Insight Questions (PIQs) to glean a fuller picture of each applicant beyond grades. Admissions readers look for personal context reflection and authenticity in these short essays. Applicants are advised to treat the PIQs like an interview or conversation answering directly with specific examples that reveal their character background and interests [oai_citation_attribution:18‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Berkeley-Freshman-Admissions-Flyer-2020-21.pdf#:~:text=For%20the%20personal%20insight%20questions,the%20four%20questions%20that%20you). The content of the essays matters more than writing polish – they are ""not looking for writing samples"" or graded on grammar but rather insight into the student's experiences resilience leadership and motivation [oai_citation_attribution:19‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Berkeley-Freshman-Admissions-Flyer-2020-21.pdf#:~:text=For%20the%20personal%20insight%20questions,the%20four%20questions%20that%20you) [oai_citation_attribution:20‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html#:~:text=Use%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%9D%20statements).

UC Berkeley,Extracurricular Evaluation,"In Berkeley's holistic review extracurricular involvement leadership roles and other non-academic activities are important factors alongside academics. Admissions readers evaluate not just participation but the depth of commitment leadership accomplishments and impact in an applicant's activities [oai_citation_attribution:24‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/how-applications-are-reviewed.html#:~:text=10,the%20context%20of%20your%20high). This includes traditional extracurriculars (clubs sports arts student government etc.) as well as family responsibilities community service work experience or other pursuits – any context in which a student has demonstrated passions talents or leadership [oai_citation_attribution:25‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Berkeley-Freshman-Admissions-Flyer-2020-21.pdf#:~:text=Holistic%20review%20also%20takes%20into,is%20participation%20in%20traditional%20clubs%2Forganizations) [oai_citation_attribution:26‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=for%20the%20community%20are%20considered). Berkeley stresses that there is no formulaic "right" activity; they value genuine involvement and achievement. Students are encouraged to fully describe their roles and time commitment (hours weeks responsibilities) and use the application's additional comments to provide context if needed [oai_citation_attribution:27‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Berkeley-Freshman-Admissions-Flyer-2020-21.pdf#:~:text=For%20the%20extracurricular%20activities%20section%2C,Berkeley%20seeks%20diverse%20and%20unique).

UC Berkeley,Special Admissions Considerations,"Berkeley's holistic process also accounts for special circumstances and populations. First-generation college students those from low-income families and students who faced significant hardships are given context in the review – readers weigh achievements against life circumstances and challenges overcome [oai_citation_attribution:33‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/how-applications-are-reviewed.html#:~:text=programs,your%20secondary%20school%20and%20residence). There are no separate quotas but about 26% of Berkeley's recent first-year admits are first-generation and a large share come from underrepresented or low-income backgrounds [oai_citation_attribution:34‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=From%20public%20schools%20From%20rural,26) [oai_citation_attribution:35‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=than%203%2C600%20students%20are%20first,Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students). Recruited athletes undergo the same application review but if an athlete (or any applicant) does not meet UC's minimum requirements they can be considered under "Admission by Exception." Only a very small percentage of students (well under 5%) are admitted by exception across UC [oai_citation_attribution:36‡senate.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/boars/documents/boars-cr-report-june-2024.pdf#:~:text=eligibility%20categories%20and%20may%20be,to%20the%20campus%20of%20choice) often for extraordinary talent (athletic artistic etc.) or serious personal circumstances. Transfer admission gives priority to California community college students – about 93% of Berkeley's transfer admits come from CA community colleges [oai_citation_attribution:37‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=From%20CCCs) – and Berkeley has programs like the Transfer Alliance Project to support academically strong students from disadvantaged backgrounds in the transfer pipeline. Additionally the University of California's Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) program guarantees UC admission (though not necessarily to Berkeley) for top 9% students in each California high school which Berkeley will consider as part of an applicant's file [oai_citation_attribution:38‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/how-applications-are-reviewed.html#:~:text=4,in%20any%20academic%20field%20of).",2024,UC Holistic Review (context factors) [oai_citation_attribution:39‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/how-applications-are-reviewed.html#:~:text=programs,your%20secondary%20school%20and%20residence); UC Berkeley data [oai_citation_attribution:40‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=From%20CCCs) [oai_citation_attribution:41‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=than%203%2C600%20students%20are%20first,Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students); UC Academic Senate report [oai_citation_attribution:42‡senate.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/boars/documents/boars-cr-report-june-2024.pdf#:~:text=eligibility%20categories%20and%20may%20be,to%20the%20campus%20of%20choice)
UC Berkeley,Changes Over the Past Five Years,"UC Berkeley's admissions policies have evolved significantly since 2020. The most notable change was the elimination of standardized test scores: the UC system made SAT/ACT optional for Fall 2021 applicants and then completely test-blind from Fall 2022 onward following a Regents decision and legal settlement [oai_citation_attribution:43‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=Nov,course%20placement%20after%20they%20enroll). By late 2021 UC announced it would not consider SAT/ACT at all for future cycles [oai_citation_attribution:44‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/preparing-freshman-students/freshman-requirements.html#:~:text=UC%20eliminated%20its%20standardized%20test,requirement%20in%202020) a policy in effect for Fall 2025 admissions and beyond. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted temporary adjustments: for applicants in 2020 and 2021 UC relaxed grading requirements by accepting Pass/No Pass grades for A-G high school courses and for transfer prerequisites without penalty [oai_citation_attribution:45‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/response-covid-19.html#:~:text=pandemic%20impact%20my%20ability%20to,eligible%20and%20competitive%20for%20UC) [oai_citation_attribution:46‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/response-covid-19.html#:~:text=I%20had%20to%20take%20units,affect%20my%20eligibility%20for%20UC).

In the past five years Berkeley has doubled down on holistic review placing greater emphasis on qualitative factors like the PIQs and extracurriculars in the absence of test scores. Other changes include new undergraduate colleges/majors (e.g. a new Data Science college) with updated requirements and adjustments in transfer policy (for example for Fall 2025 Berkeley's College of Letters & Science no longer requires full general education completion prior to transfer aligning with the seven-course pattern requirement) [oai_citation_attribution:48‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=NOTE%3A%20Effective%20for%20the%20fall,are%20separate%20from%20admission%20requirements).

UC Berkeley,Domestic and International Considerations,"Domestic (U.S.) and international applicants to Berkeley are held to the same core admissions standards with some additional requirements for international students. All freshman applicants whether in-state or international must complete an acceptable secondary school curriculum (15 ""a-g"" courses or equivalent). California residents need at least a 3.0 UC GPA whereas non-residents (including international students) must have a minimum 3.4 GPA in those courses [oai_citation_attribution:52‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html#:~:text=For%20nonresidents). International students who attended secondary school in a non-English language environment must demonstrate English proficiency via exams – for example a TOEFL score of 80 or IELTS of 6.5 (or Duolingo English Test 115) is required to show English proficiency [oai_citation_attribution:53‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Minimum%20score%20of%20115) [oai_citation_attribution:54‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Edition%3A%C2%A0Minimum%20score%20of%2080%20or). Transfer applicants from abroad are welcome though UC policy gives first priority to California community college students [oai_citation_attribution:55‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=,term%20you%20are%20applying%20for) so international transfers (especially from non-U.S. colleges) face tougher odds. Notably Berkeley does not have separate admissions quotas for international undergraduates – they undergo the same holistic review process. However the campus must adhere to UC-wide caps on non-resident enrollment (aiming around 18% maximum of undergraduates) which means international and out-of-state applicants compete for a limited portion of seats. International applicants also need to secure student visas and show financial resources but these factors are handled after admission and do not factor into the selection reading. In summary international students are evaluated academically and holistically just like domestic students but must clear the English language requirement and compete under the non-resident enrollment limits whereas U.S. applicants have the advantage of in-state eligibility pathways and for California students ELC guarantees in the UC system.",2023,UC Admissions (Intl requirements) [oai_citation_attribution:56‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/preparing-freshman-students/freshman-requirements.html#:~:text=) [oai_citation_attribution:57‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Minimum%20score%20of%20115); UC Berkeley Transfer info [oai_citation_attribution:58‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=,term%20you%20are%20applying%20for); UC Admissions GPA policy [oai_citation_attribution:59‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html#:~:text=For%20nonresidents)UCLA,GPA Requirements,No minimum GPA requirement but average unweighted GPA for admitted students is around 3.95.

UC Berkeley,Changes Over the Past Five Years,"UC Berkeley's admissions policies have evolved significantly since 2020. The most notable change was the elimination of standardized test scores: the UC system made SAT/ACT optional for Fall 2021 applicants and then completely test-blind from Fall 2022 onward following a Regents decision and legal settlement [oai_citation_attribution:43‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=Nov,course%20placement%20after%20they%20enroll). By late 2021 UC announced it would not consider SAT/ACT at all for future cycles [oai_citation_attribution:44‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/preparing-freshman-students/freshman-requirements.html#:~:text=UC%20eliminated%20its%20standardized%20test,requirement%20in%202020) a policy in effect for Fall 2025 admissions and beyond. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted temporary adjustments: for applicants in 2020 and 2021 UC relaxed grading requirements by accepting Pass/No Pass grades for A-G high school courses and for transfer prerequisites without penalty [oai_citation_attribution:45‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/response-covid-19.html#:~:text=pandemic%20impact%20my%20ability%20to,eligible%20and%20competitive%20for%20UC) [oai_citation_attribution:46‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/response-covid-19.html#:~:text=I%20had%20to%20take%20units,affect%20my%20eligibility%20for%20UC).

In the past five years Berkeley has doubled down on holistic review placing greater emphasis on qualitative factors like the PIQs and extracurriculars in the absence of test scores. Other changes include new undergraduate colleges/majors (e.g. a new Data Science college) with updated requirements and adjustments in transfer policy (for example for Fall 2025 Berkeley's College of Letters & Science no longer requires full general education completion prior to transfer aligning with the seven-course pattern requirement) [oai_citation_attribution:48‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=NOTE%3A%20Effective%20for%20the%20fall,are%20separate%20from%20admission%20requirements).

UC Berkeley,Domestic and International Considerations,"Domestic (U.S.) and international applicants to Berkeley are held to the same core admissions standards with some additional requirements for international students. All freshman applicants whether in-state or international must complete an acceptable secondary school curriculum (15 ""a-g"" courses or equivalent). California residents need at least a 3.0 UC GPA whereas non-residents (including international students) must have a minimum 3.4 GPA in those courses [oai_citation_attribution:52‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html#:~:text=For%20nonresidents). International students who attended secondary school in a non-English language environment must demonstrate English proficiency via exams – for example a TOEFL score of 80 or IELTS of 6.5 (or Duolingo English Test 115) is required to show English proficiency [oai_citation_attribution:53‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Minimum%20score%20of%20115) [oai_citation_attribution:54‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Edition%3A%C2%A0Minimum%20score%20of%2080%20or). Transfer applicants from abroad are welcome though UC policy gives first priority to California community college students [oai_citation_attribution:55‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=,term%20you%20are%20applying%20for) so international transfers (especially from non-U.S. colleges) face tougher odds. Notably Berkeley does not have separate admissions quotas for international undergraduates – they undergo the same holistic review process. However the campus must adhere to UC-wide caps on non-resident enrollment (aiming around 18% maximum of undergraduates) which means international and out-of-state applicants compete for a limited portion of seats. International applicants also need to secure student visas and show financial resources but these factors are handled after admission and do not factor into the selection reading. In summary international students are evaluated academically and holistically just like domestic students but must clear the English language requirement and compete under the non-resident enrollment limits whereas U.S. applicants have the advantage of in-state eligibility pathways and for California students ELC guarantees in the UC system.",2023,UC Admissions (Intl requirements) [oai_citation_attribution:56‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/preparing-freshman-students/freshman-requirements.html#:~:text=) [oai_citation_attribution:57‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Minimum%20score%20of%20115); UC Berkeley Transfer info [oai_citation_attribution:58‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=,term%20you%20are%20applying%20for); UC Admissions GPA policy [oai_citation_attribution:59‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html#:~:text=For%20nonresidents)UCLA,GPA Requirements,"No minimum GPA requirement but average unweighted GPA for admitted students is around 3.95.

UC Berkeley,Standardized Test Policies,"UC Berkeley no longer considers SAT or ACT scores in undergraduate admissions.

UC Berkeley,Essay Expectations,"Berkeley uses the UC Personal Insight Questions (PIQs) to glean a fuller picture of each applicant beyond grades. Admissions readers look for personal context, reflection, and authenticity in these short essays. Applicants are advised to treat the PIQs like an interview or conversation, answering directly with specific examples that reveal their character, background, and interests [oai_citation_attribution:18‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/Berkeley-Freshman-Admissions-Flyer-2020-21.pdf#:~:text=For%20the%20personal%20insight%20questions,the%20four%20questions%20that%20you).

UC Berkeley,Extracurricular Evaluation,"In Berkeley’s holistic review, extracurricular involvement, leadership roles, and other non-academic activities are important factors alongside academics.

UC Berkeley,Special Admissions Considerations,"Berkeley’s holistic process also accounts for special circumstances and populations.

There are no separate quotas, but about 26% of Berkeley’s recent first-year admits are first-generation and a large share come from underrepresented or low-income backgrounds [oai_citation_attribution:34‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=From%20public%20schools%20From%20rural,26) [oai_citation_attribution:35‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=than%203%2C600%20students%20are%20first,Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students). Recruited athletes undergo the same application review, but if an athlete (or any applicant) does not meet UC’s minimum requirements, they can be considered under “Admission by Exception.” Only a very small percentage of students (well under 5%) are admitted by exception across UC [oai_citation_attribution:36‡senate.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/boars/documents/boars-cr-report-june-2024.pdf#:~:text=eligibility%20categories%20and%20may%20be,to%20the%20campus%20of%20choice), often for extraordinary talent (athletic, artistic, etc.) or serious personal circumstances.

UC Berkeley,Changes Over the Past Five Years,"UC Berkeley’s admissions policies have evolved significantly since 2020. The most notable change was the elimination of standardized test scores: the UC system made SAT/ACT optional for Fall 2021 applicants and then completely test-blind from Fall 2022 onward, following a Regents decision and legal settlement [oai_citation_attribution:43‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=Nov,course%20placement%20after%20they%20enroll). By late 2021, UC announced it would not consider SAT/ACT at all for future cycles [oai_citation_attribution:44‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/preparing-freshman-students/freshman-requirements.html#:~:text=UC%20eliminated%20its%20standardized%20test,requirement%20in%202020), a policy in effect for Fall 2025 admissions and beyond. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted temporary adjustments: for applicants in 2020 and 2021, UC relaxed grading requirements by accepting Pass/No Pass grades for A-G high school courses and for transfer prerequisites without penalty [oai_citation_attribution:45‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/response-covid-19.html#:~:text=pandemic%20impact%20my%20ability%20to,eligible%20and%20competitive%20for%20UC) [oai_citation_attribution:46‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/response-covid-19.html#:~:text=I%20had%20to%20take%20units,affect%20my%20eligibility%20for%20UC).

In the past five years, Berkeley has doubled down on holistic review, placing greater emphasis on qualitative factors like the PIQs and extracurriculars in the absence of test scores. Other changes include new undergraduate colleges/majors (e.g. a new Data Science college) with updated requirements, and adjustments in transfer policy (for example, for Fall 2025, Berkeley’s College of Letters & Science no longer requires full general education completion prior to transfer, aligning with the seven-course pattern requirement) [oai_citation_attribution:48‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=NOTE%3A%20Effective%20for%20the%20fall,are%20separate%20from%20admission%20requirements).

UC Berkeley,Domestic and International Considerations,"Domestic (U.S.) and international applicants to Berkeley are held to the same core admissions standards, with some additional requirements for international students. All freshman applicants, whether in-state or international, must complete an acceptable secondary school curriculum (15 ""a-g"" courses or equivalent). California residents need at least a 3.0 UC GPA, whereas non-residents (including international students) must have a minimum 3.4 GPA in those courses [oai_citation_attribution:52‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html#:~:text=For%20nonresidents). International students who attended secondary school in a non-English language environment must demonstrate English proficiency via exams – for example, a TOEFL score of 80 or IELTS of 6.5 (or Duolingo English Test 115) is required to show English proficiency [oai_citation_attribution:53‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Minimum%20score%20of%20115) [oai_citation_attribution:54‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Edition%3A%C2%A0Minimum%20score%20of%2080%20or). Transfer applicants from abroad are welcome, though UC policy gives first priority to California community college students [oai_citation_attribution:55‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=,term%20you%20are%20applying%20for), so international transfers (especially from non-U.S. colleges) face tougher odds. Notably, Berkeley does not have separate admissions quotas for international undergraduates – they undergo the same holistic review process. However, the campus must adhere to UC-wide caps on non-resident enrollment (aiming around 18% maximum of undergraduates), which means international and out-of-state applicants compete for a limited portion of seats. International applicants also need to secure student visas and show financial resources, but these factors are handled after admission and do not factor into the selection reading. In summary, international students are evaluated academically and holistically just like domestic students, but must clear the English language requirement and compete under the non-resident enrollment limits, whereas U.S. applicants have the advantage of in-state eligibility pathways and, for California students, ELC guarantees in the UC system.",2023,UC Admissions (Intl requirements) [oai_citation_attribution:56‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/preparing-freshman-students/freshman-requirements.html#:~:text=) [oai_citation_attribution:57‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/english-language-proficiency.html#:~:text=,Minimum%20score%20of%20115); UC Berkeley Transfer info [oai_citation_attribution:58‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/transfer-students/transfer-requirements/#:~:text=,term%20you%20are%20applying%20for); UC Admissions GPA policy [oai_citation_attribution:59‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html#:~:text=For%20nonresidents)UCLA,GPA Requirements,No minimum GPA requirement, but average unweighted GPA for admitted students is around 3.95.

UC Berkeley,GPA requirements,"**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley requires a strong academic record. While the minimum eligibility to apply is a 3.0 GPA in UC-required courses for California residents (3.4 for non-residents) [oai_citation_attribution:0‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=%2A%20Meet%20the%20A,residents), successful applicants typically far exceed this. In fact, to be competitive at Berkeley, students generally need an academic profile much stronger than the UC minimums [oai_citation_attribution:1‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%20that%20at,University%20of%20California%20admission%20requirements). **Historical Perspective:** Admitted freshmen almost all earn A grades in high school – the middle 50% of Berkeley’s Fall 2024 admitted class had unweighted GPAs between 3.89 and 4.00 (nearly straight A’s) and weighted GPAs up to about 4.65 [oai_citation_attribution:2‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=First,4.65). The average unweighted GPA was about 3.92, with a 4.47 weighted GPA, for Fall 2024 admits, slightly higher than the prior year (4.44) [oai_citation_attribution:3‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=desirable%20destination%20for%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s,%E2%80%9D). This upward trend in admitted GPA reflects increasing competition. **Specific Data Points:** Back in Fall 2019, the admit rate was ~16% with a middle 50% weighted GPA around 4.15–4.30 [oai_citation_attribution:4‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=Applicants%3A) [oai_citation_attribution:5‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=,75%25%20students); by Fall 2024 the admit rate dropped to ~11% [oai_citation_attribution:6‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=2024%20applications%202024%20admits%202024,125%2C922%20%C2%A014%2C772%2011.2) and average GPAs rose above 4.4. Berkeley considers both weighted and unweighted GPAs, looking at performance in required “A-G” courses in 10th-11th grade and beyond. They assess not just the GPA number but also the rigor of coursework – the number of Honors, AP, IB, or college-level classes a student took, and performance relative to what was available at their school [oai_citation_attribution:7‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=,UC%20applicants%20at%20your%20school). **Holistic Nuances:** GPA is evaluated in context: readers examine grade trends (improvement or consistency), the difficulty of courses, and how the student maximized opportunities. There is no fixed “cut-off” GPA for admission, but given Berkeley’s large applicant pool, admitted students’ GPAs tend to be very high. The admissions office emphasizes that strong academics are necessary but not sufficient – nearly all applicants meet the minimum GPA, so Berkeley uses comprehensive review to go “beyond the numbers” when comparing students [oai_citation_attribution:8‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=Each%20application%20undergoes%20a%20holistic,by%20word%2C%20page%20by%20page).","2025"," [oai_citation_attribution:9‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=%2A%20Meet%20the%20A,residents); [oai_citation_attribution:10‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=First,4.65); [oai_citation_attribution:11‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=desirable%20destination%20for%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s,%E2%80%9D); [oai_citation_attribution:12‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=Applicants%3A)"
UC Berkeley,Standardized test policies,"**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley is **test-free** in admissions, meaning SAT and ACT scores are **not considered at all** during application review [oai_citation_attribution:13‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=Berkeley%20is%20test,in%20the%20application%20review%20process). This policy applies to all freshman applicants as part of the University of California system’s shift away from standardized testing. **Historical Perspective:** In May 2020, the UC Board of Regents voted to suspend SAT/ACT requirements and planned a phase-out over five years [oai_citation_attribution:14‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20California%20Board,testing%20requirement%20for%20California%20students). Initially, for Fall 2021 and 2022 applicants, tests were optional, and by Fall 2023 the UC system moved to **test-blind** admissions (scores, even if submitted, could not be used) [oai_citation_attribution:15‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=%2A%20Test,for%20the%20statewide%20admissions%20guarantee). A subsequent legal settlement accelerated this timeline, so **since Fall 2021 Berkeley has not used SAT/ACT scores at all**. By 2022, UC decided not to develop a new exam, making the test-free policy permanent. **Specific Data Points:** Prior to these changes, admitted Berkeley students had very high test scores – for example, the middle 50% of Fall 2019 admits scored 30–35 on the ACT, and about 1340–1540 (combined) on the SAT [oai_citation_attribution:16‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=,75%25%20students). Now, with tests eliminated, Berkeley places greater weight on academics, essays, and extracurricular achievements. The university will still consider **AP or IB exam scores**, SAT Subject Test scores (when available in the past), or other external exams as **optional supplements** to showcase mastery [oai_citation_attribution:17‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=,exams%20and%20SAT%20subject%20exams), but **SAT/ACT scores are entirely excluded** from admission and scholarship decisions. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s comprehensive review ensures that without test scores, other factors like GPA (especially in rigorous courses), leadership, talents, and personal qualities are more closely examined [oai_citation_attribution:18‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=,UC%20applicants%20at%20your%20school) [oai_citation_attribution:19‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=Berkeley%20is%20test,in%20the%20application%20review%20process). The removal of standardized tests was partly to broaden access and equity, and officials note that it hasn’t lowered standards, as applicants continue to self-select with strong academic records. As of the Fall 2025 cycle, submitting SAT or ACT scores is neither required nor useful – **Berkeley will not look at them**. Applicants, especially international students from non-English speaking schools, may need to submit TOEFL/IELTS for English proficiency, but **no general standardized tests are used for admission review**.","2025"," [oai_citation_attribution:20‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=Berkeley%20is%20test,in%20the%20application%20review%20process); [oai_citation_attribution:21‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing#:~:text=%2A%20Test,for%20the%20statewide%20admissions%20guarantee); [oai_citation_attribution:22‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=,75%25%20students)"
UC Berkeley,Essay expectations,"**Expanded Explanation:** Applicants to Berkeley must respond to the University of California Personal Insight Questions (PIQs) – a set of short essays that are a **vital part** of the application [oai_citation_attribution:23‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/#:~:text=As%20a%20vital%20part%20of,the%20Admissions%20and%20Scholarship%20offices). Freshman applicants choose **4 out of 8 prompts**, with each response up to **350 words** [oai_citation_attribution:24‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html#:~:text=,best%20reflect%20your%20individual%20circumstances). These prompts invite students to share personal stories and reflections on leadership, creativity, talents, challenges overcome, and more. **Historical Perspective:** The PIQ format (adopted UC-wide in 2016) has remained consistent over the past five years, but its importance has grown as applications have become more competitive and standardized tests were removed. Admissions officers use the essays to **discover and evaluate distinctions among applicants whose academic records are often very similar** [oai_citation_attribution:25‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/#:~:text=At%20Berkeley%20we%20use%20personal,insight%20questions%20to). In other words, with so many students having outstanding grades, the essays help reveal each student’s unique experiences, character, and voice. Berkeley’s readers from both the Admissions and Scholarship offices review these responses [oai_citation_attribution:26‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/#:~:text=As%20a%20vital%20part%20of,the%20Admissions%20and%20Scholarship%20offices), underscoring their significance not just for admission but also for merit awards. **Specific Data Points:** Every applicant answers four PIQs, all given equal consideration (no prompt is favored over another) [oai_citation_attribution:27‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html#:~:text=,best%20reflect%20your%20individual%20circumstances) [oai_citation_attribution:28‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/personal-insight-questions.html#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind). Common topics include leadership examples, creative projects, significant challenges, academic passions, or community involvement. Each essay is limited to 350 words, so students must be concise and reflective. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley looks for qualities such as *initiative, motivation, leadership, persistence, service to others,* and cultural awareness through these essays [oai_citation_attribution:29‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/personal-insight-questions/#:~:text=,including%20it%20in%20your%20application).

UC Berkeley,Extracurricular evaluation,"**Expanded Explanation:** Berkeley conducts a holistic review that places substantial emphasis on **extracurricular involvement, leadership, and achievements** outside the classroom. Rather than requiring specific activities, the admissions readers assess how each applicant chose to spend their time and **what impact or accomplishments** they achieved in those pursuits [oai_citation_attribution:39‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=5,are%20excluded%20from%20the%20criteria). This includes traditional extracurriculars (like clubs, student government, sports, arts, and community service) as well as work experience, family responsibilities, or unique hobbies. The key is **quality and depth over quantity**: sustained commitment or notable achievements in a few areas can stand out more than superficial involvement in many. **Historical Perspective:** Over the past five years, as the applicant pool has grown and test scores were removed from consideration, Berkeley has increasingly highlighted the importance of non-academic factors. The university pioneered holistic review in the UC system, focusing on building a diverse class with varied talents and backgrounds [oai_citation_attribution:40‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/selection-process/#:~:text=UC%20Berkeley%20pioneered%20the%20holistic,applications%20where%20all%20academic%20and). This means that strong extracurriculars and personal qualities have long been important, but they may carry even more weight now in differentiating top students. Berkeley has seen applicants with leadership roles in community initiatives, significant research or coding projects, standout athletic talent, or other exceptional extracurricular accomplishments, and these experiences often complement academic strength in admissions decisions. **Specific Data Points:** There is no formula for extracurriculars, but the profile of admitted students shows high involvement: for example, a large portion of Berkeley freshmen have participated in leadership or volunteer work, and many have earned awards or distinctions in arts, science, or other fields (though the university does not publish a numeric breakdown of activities, these elements are reflected qualitatively in the *comprehensive review*). **Holistic Nuances:** Evaluators consider extracurricular achievements in the **context** of each applicant’s opportunities [oai_citation_attribution:41‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=All%20achievements%2C%20both%20academic%20and,support%20available%20in%20the%20home). They ask questions like: Did the student show initiative or hold leadership roles (formally or informally)? Did they achieve something significant or demonstrate passion and growth? How did the student balance commitments, especially if they faced obligations like part-time jobs or family care? Importantly, Berkeley defines leadership broadly – “leadership” can mean being a team captain or club president, but it can also be demonstrated through initiating a project, mentoring others, or overcoming challenges [oai_citation_attribution:42‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=Each%20application%20undergoes%20a%20holistic,by%20word%2C%20page%20by%20page). The admissions guidelines explicitly recognize *“exemplary, sustained achievement in any field of intellectual or creative endeavor; accomplishments in extracurricular activities such as the performing arts or athletics; leadership in school or community organizations; employment; and volunteer service”* as positives in an application [oai_citation_attribution:43‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=5,are%20excluded%20from%20the%20criteria). In summary, Berkeley looks for meaningful engagement: applicants who have made a positive impact or shown dedication beyond academics are viewed favorably, especially when those contributions align with their passions and the values of the university.","2025"," [oai_citation_attribution:44‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=5,are%20excluded%20from%20the%20criteria); [oai_citation_attribution:45‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=All%20achievements%2C%20both%20academic%20and,support%20available%20in%20the%20home); [oai_citation_attribution:46‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=Each%20application%20undergoes%20a%20holistic,by%20word%2C%20page%20by%20page); [oai_citation_attribution:47‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/application-resources/selection-process/#:~:text=UC%20Berkeley%20pioneered%20the%20holistic,applications%20where%20all%20academic%20and)"
UC Berkeley,Special admissions considerations,"**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley employs policies to ensure that students with unique backgrounds, challenges, or talents are given fair consideration. The admissions process explicitly **does not consider race, ethnicity, gender, or religion** in compliance with California law (Proposition 209) [oai_citation_attribution:48‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=6,are%20excluded%20from%20the%20criteria). However, Berkeley **does consider the context** of each applicant’s life – factors like being a first-generation college student, coming from a low-income family or a rural area, attending a disadvantaged school, or overcoming significant hardship or disability are all taken into account as part of the holistic review [oai_citation_attribution:49‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=All%20achievements%2C%20both%20academic%20and,support%20available%20in%20the%20home).

In 2020, a state ballot measure (Prop 16) sought to reinstate affirmative action but was not passed, so Berkeley continues to pursue diversity through race-neutral means. The university has increased outreach to underrepresented communities and, as noted in 2024 admissions, about 3,800 of the admitted first-year students were from underrepresented minority groups (African American, Latinx, Native American, etc.) despite the ban on considering race [oai_citation_attribution:52‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=The%20students%20come%20from%2057,Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students). Additionally, Berkeley has steadily enrolled a significant number of first-generation college students (roughly 26% of Fall 2024 admits were first-gen) [oai_citation_attribution:53‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=From%20public%20schools%20From%20rural,26), indicating its commitment to socioeconomic diversity. **Specific Data Points:** The UC system’s *Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC)* program guarantees UC admission (though not necessarily to Berkeley) for the top 9% of students in each California high school. Berkeley gives special attention to ELC-designated applicants as part of its comprehensive review, recognizing their achievement in context. Moreover, UC policy allows for *“Admission by Exception”* – up to 6% of an incoming class can be admitted despite not meeting every UC minimum requirement, if they possess exceptional talent or come from a disadvantaged background [oai_citation_attribution:54‡calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2019/08/college-scandal-admission-exception-uc-california-side-door-sports-money-diversity-secrecy/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20Varsity%20Blues%20scandal,come%20from%20a%20disadvantaged%20background). In practice, Berkeley uses this for cases like outstanding athletes, artists, or students who experienced extreme hardship that affected part of their academics. Such candidates must still demonstrate potential to succeed at Berkeley. **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s review readers are trained to evaluate each file in context. They consider if the applicant had limited access to advanced courses or extracurriculars and how they made use of what was available. If an applicant has faced unusual circumstances (for example, homelessness, refugee status, significant family responsibilities, or a disability), the review will weigh the *“maturity, determination and insight”* shown in overcoming those challenges [oai_citation_attribution:55‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=All%20achievements%2C%20both%20academic%20and,support%20available%20in%20the%20home). To gather more information on special cases, Berkeley can invoke the **Augmented Review** process: a small percentage of applicants may be asked to provide additional materials, such as a questionnaire, seventh-semester grades, or up to two recommendation letters, to shed light on *“extraordinary circumstances or special talents”* [oai_citation_attribution:56‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Campuses%20may%20request%20an%20additional,that%20the%20applicant%20has%20encountered) [oai_citation_attribution:57‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Letters%20of%20recommendation%20can%20be,applicants%20given%20a%20special%20review). (Notably, UC Berkeley normally does *not* accept recommendation letters, except when an Augmented Review is triggered for a particular applicant.) **Official Validation:** All these special considerations operate within UC’s formal guidelines. For example, Regents policy caps *non-resident* enrollment (to prioritize Californians) and state law mandates race-blind admissions, but Berkeley still achieves diversity through holistic review. The **Berkeley Admissions Office and UC Office of the President** regularly report statistics on first-gen students, low-income students, and other groups to ensure transparency [oai_citation_attribution:58‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=The%20students%20come%20from%2057,Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students) [oai_citation_attribution:59‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=From%20public%20schools%20From%20rural,26).

UC Berkeley,Changes over the past five years,"**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley’s admissions have become **more competitive and evolved** in policy from 2020 through 2025. The university saw a significant **increase in applications** – from about 87,000 freshman applicants in Fall 2019 to roughly 125,000+ in Fall 2022-2023 [oai_citation_attribution:65‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=Applicants%3A) [oai_citation_attribution:66‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=2024%20applications%202024%20admits%202024,125%2C922%20%C2%A014%2C772%2011.2) – which led to lower admit rates and higher academic benchmarks. In recent cycles, Berkeley’s freshman **admit rate has hovered around 11%** [oai_citation_attribution:67‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=2024%20applications%202024%20admits%202024,125%2C922%20%C2%A014%2C772%2011.2), down from 16–17% five years ago [oai_citation_attribution:68‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=Admits%3A). Alongside this growth, UC Berkeley (and the UC system at large) made major policy shifts: **Standardized tests were eliminated.** In 2020, the UC Regents approved dropping the SAT/ACT requirement; by Fall 2021 admissions, Berkeley went test-optional due to the pandemic, and soon after became fully **test-blind** (not considering scores at all) [oai_citation_attribution:69‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-temporarily-eases-admissions-requirements-response-educational-disruptions#:~:text=The%20measures%20include%20suspending%20the,have%20moved%20to%20pass%2Ffail%20grading) [oai_citation_attribution:70‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-temporarily-eases-admissions-requirements-response-educational-disruptions#:~:text=UC%20has%20temporarily%20suspended%20the,enter%20UC%20as%20a%20junior). A legal agreement in 2021 ensured no UC would use test scores through 2025, and ultimately UC decided to make the change permanent. This was one of the most impactful changes in the last five years. **Historical Perspective:** The COVID-19 pandemic (2020) also forced temporary adjustments: UC suspended letter-grade requirements for A-G courses in Spring 2020 (allowing Pass/No Pass grades without penalty) and extended admissions deadlines to accommodate students [oai_citation_attribution:71‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-temporarily-eases-admissions-requirements-response-educational-disruptions#:~:text=The%20measures%20include%20suspending%20the,have%20moved%20to%20pass%2Ffail%20grading). Those measures were emergency responses and have since expired, but they set the stage for more flexible, holistic considerations (and underscored the value of looking beyond test scores). In terms of admissions strategy, Berkeley has also responded to public pressure and state mandates to prioritize California residents. **Specific Data Points:** In 2021, the California state budget and UC Board pushed campuses like Berkeley to increase in-state enrollment. As a result, Berkeley’s Fall 2024 admitted class was 79% California residents, up from 75% the year before [oai_citation_attribution:72‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=California%20residents%20admitted%20in%20alignment,the%20governor%20and%20the%20Legislature), reflecting a deliberate shift to admit more Californians. Another notable change occurred in early 2022 when a court-ordered **enrollment cap** threatened to force Berkeley to reduce admissions; this led to swift legislative action that allowed the university to resume normal admission volumes [oai_citation_attribution:73‡calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2022/03/uc-enrollment-cap-fix/#:~:text=Lawmakers%20pass%20legislative%20fix%20to,Gavin%20Newsom%27s%20desk). Berkeley did, however, slightly reduce the number of admission offers in 2024 to better control enrollment after higher-than-expected yields in prior years [oai_citation_attribution:74‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=This%20year%E2%80%99s%20admitted%20class%20faced,more%20students%20enrolled%20than%20%C2%A0anticipated). Over five years, the **academic profile** of admitted students has remained extremely high or risen – for instance, the average unweighted GPA of admits held around 3.92 [oai_citation_attribution:75‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=This%20year%E2%80%99s%20admitted%20class%20of,44%20last%20year), and the average fully weighted GPA increased (from roughly 4.4 to 4.47 between 2020 and 2024) [oai_citation_attribution:76‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=desirable%20destination%20for%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s,%E2%80%9D). Meanwhile, metrics like test scores are no longer tracked, and more emphasis is placed on qualitative factors. **Holistic Nuances:** With each passing year, Berkeley has doubled down on **holistic review**. The removal of tests meant readers consider personal insight essays and extracurriculars even more intensively to gauge traits like leadership, creativity, and resilience. During the pandemic, readers were mindful of applicants’ limited opportunities for activities or testing, and adjusted expectations accordingly. The university also updated its **Augmented Review** policy (in 2017, refined in 2022) to allow seeking additional context (including recommendation letters) for up to 15% of borderline cases [oai_citation_attribution:77‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Campuses%20may%20request%20an%20additional,that%20the%20applicant%20has%20encountered) [oai_citation_attribution:78‡regents.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2110.html#:~:text=Letters%20of%20recommendation%20can%20be,applicants%20given%20a%20special%20review), ensuring no student is overlooked due to unusual circumstances. In summary, the 2020–2025 period has seen Berkeley admissions become **more selective** and adapt to external challenges: testing was phased out, application numbers hit new highs, and policies were tweaked to maintain fairness and a strong commitment to in-state students. The class entering Fall 2025 will be the culmination of these trends – a class chosen entirely without test scores, with record-high applications, and with a composition shaped by the university’s focus on diversity, excellence, and resilience.","2025"," [oai_citation_attribution:79‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/student-profile/#:~:text=2024%20applications%202024%20admits%202024,125%2C922%20%C2%A014%2C772%2011.2); [oai_citation_attribution:80‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/berkeley/freshman-admission-profile.html#:~:text=Admits%3A); [oai_citation_attribution:81‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-temporarily-eases-admissions-requirements-response-educational-disruptions#:~:text=UC%20has%20temporarily%20suspended%20the,enter%20UC%20as%20a%20junior); [oai_citation_attribution:82‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=California%20residents%20admitted%20in%20alignment,the%20governor%20and%20the%20Legislature); [oai_citation_attribution:83‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=This%20year%E2%80%99s%20admitted%20class%20of,44%20last%20year)"
UC Berkeley,Domestic/international considerations,"**Expanded Explanation:** UC Berkeley being a public university in California prioritizes **in-state (domestic) students** while also welcoming talented students from across the U.S. and around the world. **Domestic (California residents)** benefit from certain policies: by UC rules, California students need a minimum 3.0 GPA in A-G courses to be eligible to apply, whereas **non-resident** (out-of-state U.S. and international) applicants must have at least a 3.4 GPA in those courses [oai_citation_attribution:84‡admissions.berkeley.edu](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/apply-to-berkeley/freshmen/freshmen-requirements/#:~:text=%2A%20Meet%20the%20A,residents). Additionally, the UC Board of Regents enforces limits on out-of-state and international enrollment. At Berkeley, non-resident undergraduates have been capped at roughly the level they were in 2017 (around 24% of the student body) [oai_citation_attribution:85‡universityofcalifornia.edu](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-board-regents-approves-policy-nonresident-student-enrollment#:~:text=Under%20the%20policy%2C%20the%20first,in%20the%202017%E2%80%9318%20academic%20year). In recent freshman classes, this translates to roughly 20-25% of admits being non-California students – for Fall 2024, about 21% of admitted freshmen were from out-of-state or overseas, as 79% were Californians [oai_citation_attribution:86‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=California%20residents%20admitted%20in%20alignment,the%20governor%20and%20the%20Legislature). **International Applicants:** If a student requires a visa to study, Berkeley considers them international. They must meet the same academic standards (completion of a rigorous secondary curriculum with high grades) and **demonstrate English language proficiency** if educated in a non-English environment. UC’s systemwide requirements include exams like TOEFL (minimum score 80 iBT) or IELTS (6.5+) to show English proficiency for international students [oai_citation_attribution:87‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/international-applicants/english-language-proficiency-toefl-ielts.html#:~:text=,Minimum%20score%20of%20115). International transcripts are evaluated according to country-specific contexts – for instance, A-levels, IB diplomas, or national exam results are considered alongside or in lieu of a GPA, and UC provides guidelines for different countries’ educational systems. **Out-of-State Applicants:** Students from other U.S. states are held to the same holistic criteria as Californians. There is no admission preference given to non-residents; in fact, because non-resident enrollment is capped, out-of-state applicants face a competitive process for a limited number of spots. That said, out-of-state admits at Berkeley often have academic credentials on par with the top in-state students (since all applicants compete in the same pool). **Holistic Nuances:** Berkeley’s comprehensive review weighs achievements in context for all students, but readers will consider an applicant’s environment – for example, if an international student had to learn English recently or an out-of-state student comes from an underserved region, those factors become part of the context. No quotas exist for specific states or countries, but Berkeley strives for geographic diversity as a secondary goal.

Financial considerations do not directly factor into admission, but international and out-of-state students must show they can afford higher non-resident tuition (Berkeley is need-blind for U.S. students, but international applicants are not offered need-based aid). Importantly, **all applications are reviewed with the same criteria**, and every applicant, domestic or international, is expected to demonstrate academic excellence and personal accomplishments. The additional requirements for non-residents (higher GPA threshold and English testing) ensure they are prepared for Berkeley’s rigor. In summary, Berkeley maintains a balance: honoring its public mission to educate Californians first, while also selecting outstanding students globally who enrich the campus with diverse perspectives [oai_citation_attribution:89‡news.berkeley.edu](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/02/almost-80-of-uc-berkeleys-first-year-admits-are-from-california/#:~:text=The%20students%20come%20from%2057,Islander%2C%20Hmong%20and%20Laotian%20students).

UC Berkeley,Need-Based Aid (Low-Income Students),"UC Berkeley provides extensive need-based aid for low-income undergraduates. Students from families with very low incomes often have their tuition fully covered by grants and scholarships, such as the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan which guarantees that systemwide tuition is covered for California residents with family income under $80,000 [oai_citation_attribution:0‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/tuition-financial-aid/types-of-aid/blue-and-gold-opportunity-plan.html#:~:text=UC%27s%20Blue%20and%20Gold%20Opportunity,and%20that%27s%20just%20for%20starters). These students typically receive federal Pell Grants, Cal Grants (for eligible Californians), and Berkeley institutional grants to cover a large portion of costs [oai_citation_attribution:1‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/grants/cal-grants/#:~:text=California%E2%80%99s%20Investing%20in%20You). Work-study opportunities are offered and subsidized student loans (e.g. Direct Subsidized Loans) may be included to fill remaining need. To qualify, students must submit the FAFSA or California Dream Act Application by the priority deadline (usually March 2) and demonstrate financial need; aid awards are determined based on the cost of attendance minus the expected family contribution [oai_citation_attribution:2‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=Financial%20Aid%20Applications). Key strategies to maximize aid include applying early, meeting all documentation deadlines, and exploring outside scholarships to supplement UC Berkeley’s aid package.",2024,University of California – Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan【18】; UC Berkeley Financial Aid & Scholarships – Undergraduate Aid Programs【39】
UC Berkeley,Need-Based Aid (Middle-Income Families),"UC Berkeley also strives to help middle-income families. California residents from middle-income backgrounds (roughly up to around $200,000 in family income) can benefit from programs like the Middle Class Scholarship, which provides a sliding-scale scholarship to undergraduates with family incomes and assets up to about $217,000-$226,000 [oai_citation_attribution:3‡finaid.ucsb.edu](http://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/scholarships/middle-class-scholarship#:~:text=The%20Middle%20Class%20Scholarship%20provides,25%20academic%20year%20only). The MCS is designed to replace some of the loan or work-study expectations in eligible students’ financial aid packages, reducing debt burden for middle-class students [oai_citation_attribution:4‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/mcs-updates/#:~:text=,be%20replaced%20with%20gift%20aid). Many middle-income students who demonstrate financial need still receive some UC Berkeley grant aid or a state Cal Grant (which helps make college affordable for middle- and low-income Californians) [oai_citation_attribution:5‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/grants/cal-grants/#:~:text=California%E2%80%99s%20Investing%20in%20You), though their aid packages may include more in federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans or parent PLUS loans to cover remaining costs. All applicants should file the FAFSA/Dream Act by the deadline to be considered for these programs. Note that state-funded awards (Cal Grants, MCS) require California residency or AB 540 status; out-of-state students are not eligible for those and must rely on federal aid, campus scholarships, or private loans [oai_citation_attribution:6‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20Financial%20aid%20supported,based%20aid%20where%20available).",2024,University of California – Middle Class Scholarship Program【13】; California Student Aid Commission – Middle Class Scholarship【41】
UC Berkeley,Merit-Based Aid,"UC Berkeley offers a variety of merit-based scholarships and awards based on academic excellence and special achievements. The most prestigious is the Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholarship, given to a select cohort of top incoming students who exemplify Berkeley’s commitment to excellence [oai_citation_attribution:7‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/scholarships/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship/#:~:text=The%20Regents%E2%80%99%20and%20Chancellor%E2%80%99s%20Scholarship,Berkeley%20to%20entering%20undergraduate%20students). Regents’ Scholars with financial need receive scholarships covering their full demonstrated need, while those without need receive a $2,500 annual honorarium; the award is renewable for up to 8 semesters and comes with perks like priority course registration, faculty mentorship, research funding opportunities, and guaranteed on-campus housing [oai_citation_attribution:8‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FASO_220112_RC-Brochure-Digital_7.5x10_R.pdf#:~:text=EXCLUSIVE%20SCHOLAR%20BENEFITS%20Monetary%20Award%3A,four%20semesters%20for%20transfer%20students) [oai_citation_attribution:9‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FASO_220112_RC-Brochure-Digital_7.5x10_R.pdf#:~:text=Priority%20Class%20Enrollment%3A%20Scholars%20are,funding%20of%20up%20to%20%241%2C000). Berkeley also administers the Berkeley Undergraduate Scholarship program, which awards thousands of undergraduates based on a combination of high GPA and financial need [oai_citation_attribution:10‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/scholarships/berkeley-undergraduate-scholarship/#:~:text=New%20and%20continuing%20students%20who,academic%20merit%20and%20financial%20need) (students with financial need and a GPA below the 3.5 threshold are awarded a University Grant instead [oai_citation_attribution:11‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/scholarships/berkeley-undergraduate-scholarship/#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20the%20scholarship,are%20awarded%20a%20University%20Grant)). Additional merit-oriented awards include the Fiat Lux Scholarship (for students from certain underrepresented high schools) and various departmental or donor-sponsored scholarships. Generally, entering students are automatically considered for merit awards through their UC application (no separate application is required for Regents and many other campus scholarships). To keep merit scholarships, students must meet renewal requirements (e.g., maintain a minimum GPA and full-time enrollment) [oai_citation_attribution:12‡financialaid.ucla.edu](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/types-of-aid/scholarships#:~:text=%2A%20The%20Regents%20Scholarship%20need,within%20UCLA%20to%20continue%20to). Insider tips for securing merit funding include emphasizing your leadership, service, and talents in your application, applying for specialized scholarships that fit your background, and utilizing Berkeley’s Scholarship Connection and other databases to find outside scholarship opportunities.",2024,UC Berkeley Financial Aid & Scholarships – Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholarship【48】; UC Berkeley Financial Aid & Scholarships – Scholarship Programs【22】
UC Berkeley,International Student Aid,"Financial aid for international undergraduate students at UC Berkeley is extremely limited. International students (on student visas) are not eligible for the need-based university, state, or federal financial aid programs administered through Berkeley’s Financial Aid office [oai_citation_attribution:13‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/how-aid-works/eligibility/#:~:text=Funding%20an%20education%20as%20an,Financial%20Aid%20and%20Scholarships%20Office), and they must demonstrate sufficient funds to cover their tuition and living expenses (on the order of $75,000+ per year) as part of the visa requirement [oai_citation_attribution:14‡admission.ucla.edu](https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/international-applicants#:~:text=UCLA%20does%20not%20award%20scholarships,amount%20usually%20grows%20each%20year). That said, international applicants are automatically considered for certain merit scholarships during admission — notably the prestigious Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholarship — although only a very small number of international students receive these awards [oai_citation_attribution:15‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FASO_220112_RC-Brochure-Digital_7.5x10_R.pdf#:~:text=Incoming%20California%20residents%2C%20domestic%20non,candidates%20are%20assessed%20for%20outstanding). Generally, international undergraduates must rely on personal and family funding, but they can seek out scholarships from private sources or their home country to help finance their studies [oai_citation_attribution:16‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/how-aid-works/eligibility/#:~:text=and%20Scholarships%20Office). UC Berkeley’s Berkeley International Office provides guidance on funding and even administers a few need-based awards and emergency loans for international students with unexpected financial hardship [oai_citation_attribution:17‡internationaloffice.berkeley.edu](https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/financialaid_from_ucb.pdf#:~:text=means%20that%20much%2C%20but%20not,Sponsored%20by%20BIO%20for%20complete) [oai_citation_attribution:18‡internationaloffice.berkeley.edu](https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/financialaid_from_ucb.pdf#:~:text=Cal%20Student%20Central%20is%20a,each). International students may also work on-campus (up to 20 hours per week during the semester) to earn money for personal expenses. Overall, planning for full self-funding is crucial, as UC Berkeley’s financial aid for non-U.S. students is very limited.",2024,Berkeley International Office – Financial Aid for International Students【55】; UC Berkeley Financial Aid – Eligibility for International Students【2】
UCLA,Need-Based Aid (Low-Income Students),"UCLA offers robust need-based financial aid to support low-income students. For California residents with family income below $80,000, the University of California’s Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan ensures that systemwide tuition is fully covered by grants and scholarships [oai_citation_attribution:19‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=,MCSP). In practice, low-income UCLA undergraduates typically receive a combination of federal Pell Grants, California state Cal Grants, and UCLA University Grants (campus-funded need-based grants) to cover tuition and many fees [oai_citation_attribution:20‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=,Federal). Eligible students may also get Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and participate in the work-study program to earn part of their expenses. After grants and work-study, subsidized student loans are offered to meet remaining need, helping keep student debt relatively low. (Notably, UCLA’s average student loan debt at graduation is about $22,000, well below the national average [oai_citation_attribution:21‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20graduating%20seniors%20in,%E2%80%94%20successfully%20manage%20loan%20repayment).) To maximize need-based aid, students should submit the FAFSA or CA Dream Act application by the March 2 priority deadline [oai_citation_attribution:22‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=Financial%20Aid%20Applications), ensure their GPA is reported for Cal Grant consideration, and promptly complete any verification paperwork. UCLA’s Financial Aid office also encourages low-income students to seek additional private scholarships and to communicate any special circumstances for potential aid adjustments.",2024,UCLA Undergraduate Admission – Financial Aid & Scholarships【5】; UCLA Financial Aid & Scholarships – Grants and Programs【7】
UCLA,Need-Based Aid (Middle-Income Families),"UCLA’s financial aid program also supports middle-income families, though these students often receive a mix of smaller grants and affordable loan options. California residents with moderate incomes above the Blue and Gold cutoff may benefit from the Middle Class Scholarship, a state program for families with income and assets up to approximately $217,000 [oai_citation_attribution:23‡finaid.ucsb.edu](http://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/scholarships/middle-class-scholarship#:~:text=The%20Middle%20Class%20Scholarship%20provides,25%20academic%20year%20only). The Middle Class Scholarship at UCLA can cover a portion of tuition and campus fees – effectively reducing the self-help (loans/work) component of aid packages for eligible middle-income students [oai_citation_attribution:24‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/mcs-updates/#:~:text=,be%20replaced%20with%20gift%20aid). Middle-income students who demonstrate need might also receive some UCLA University Grant funding or a Cal Grant A (if within the program’s income and GPA criteria) [oai_citation_attribution:25‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/grants/cal-grants/#:~:text=California%E2%80%99s%20Investing%20in%20You), but often will be offered Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans and parent PLUS loans to finance the remaining costs. All students should still apply for aid by the March 2 deadline to be considered for every program. It’s important to note that UCLA cannot offer state-funded awards like Cal Grants or the Middle Class Scholarship to non-California residents [oai_citation_attribution:26‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20Financial%20aid%20supported,based%20aid%20where%20available), so out-of-state middle-income students generally rely on federal aid, university scholarships, and family contributions. Middle-income families are advised to explore tax-advantaged college savings plans, pursue external scholarships, and consider UCLA’s BruinPay Plan (tuition installment plan) to help manage college costs.",2024,University of California – Middle Class Scholarship Program【13】; UCLA Financial Aid & Scholarships – Middle Class Scholarship Info【7】
UCLA,Merit-Based Aid,"Merit-based aid at UCLA includes several prestigious scholarships for high-achieving students. The UCLA Regents Scholarship is the premier merit award, offered to top freshman applicants and providing an honorarium of $2,000 per year (renewable for four years) for each Regents Scholar [oai_citation_attribution:27‡financialaid.ucla.edu](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/types-of-aid/scholarships#:~:text=,NOT%20awarded%20in%20the%20summer). If a Regents Scholar has financial need beyond that amount, UCLA will augment their award with additional scholarship/grant funds to meet their need, effectively making this a full-need award for those students [oai_citation_attribution:28‡financialaid.ucla.edu](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/types-of-aid/scholarships#:~:text=,NOT%20awarded%20in%20the%20summer). Other UCLA merit awards include the UCLA Alumni Scholarship (funded by the Alumni Association, which requires a separate application and is based on leadership, service and academic talent) and the UCLA Achievement Scholarship, which considers both merit and financial need. Selection criteria for these awards typically involve outstanding academics, extracurricular leadership, and personal character. Recipients must maintain good academic standing (e.g., a minimum 3.0 GPA and full-time enrollment) to renew their awards each year. UCLA also directs students to numerous external merit scholarships; the campus’s Scholarship Resource Center helps students find and apply for private scholarships, and databases like Fastweb and College Board’s scholarship search are recommended tools [oai_citation_attribution:29‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=,offer%20scholarships%20for%20community%20service). To maximize chances for merit aid, incoming students should meet all application deadlines (for example, submitting UCLA’s optional scholarship application or Alumni Scholarship application on time) and showcase their achievements and unique story throughout their application.",2024,UCLA Undergraduate Admission – Scholarships & Merit Awards【5】; UCLA Financial Aid & Scholarships – Scholarship Programs【10】
UCLA,International Student Aid,"UCLA does not offer need-based financial aid or university scholarships to international undergraduates. According to UCLA Undergraduate Admissions, non-U.S. citizens and non-permanent residents are ineligible for UCLA scholarships or aid, and must prove they have sufficient funds (around $76,000 for the first year) to cover all expenses [oai_citation_attribution:30‡admission.ucla.edu](https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/international-applicants#:~:text=UCLA%20does%20not%20award%20scholarships,amount%20usually%20grows%20each%20year). The UCLA Financial Aid Office confirms that federal, state, and institutional aid programs are not available to students with F-1 or J-1 visas [oai_citation_attribution:31‡financialaid.ucla.edu](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/how-aid-works/apply-for-aid#:~:text=,SIGN%20THE%20LOAN). International students at UCLA are generally limited to financing options such as private scholarships, private educational loans (almost always requiring a U.S. co-signer), and short-term emergency loans from the university [oai_citation_attribution:32‡financialaid.ucla.edu](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/how-aid-works/apply-for-aid#:~:text=,SIGN%20THE%20LOAN). In practice, this means international students should plan to self-fund the full cost of attendance. UCLA provides some guidance for international students seeking funding: the Scholarship Resource Center and UCLA’s scholarship database can be used to find any scholarships open to international students, and UCLA highlights online scholarship search tools geared toward international student funding [oai_citation_attribution:33‡financialaid.ucla.edu](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/how-aid-works/apply-for-aid#:~:text=,Students%20include). International undergraduates may also work on campus part-time within visa restrictions, but earnings will only cover a fraction of costs. It is crucial for international applicants to secure adequate funding in advance, as UCLA’s aid for international students is extremely limited.",2024,UCLA Undergraduate Admission – International Students (Funding)【24】; UCLA Financial Aid Office – International Student Aid Policy【54】
UC San Diego,Need-Based Aid (Low-Income Students),"UC San Diego provides substantial need-based aid to low-income undergraduate students, helping make a UC education attainable. Low-income California students (family income under $80,000) are covered by the UC Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, ensuring that their systemwide tuition is fully paid through grants and scholarships [oai_citation_attribution:34‡admission.universityofcalifornia.edu](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/tuition-financial-aid/types-of-aid/blue-and-gold-opportunity-plan.html#:~:text=UC%27s%20Blue%20and%20Gold%20Opportunity,and%20that%27s%20just%20for%20starters). In addition, UCSD undergraduates with high financial need receive federal Pell Grants, Cal Grants from the state of California, and UC San Diego institutional grants to cover educational expenses. UCSD’s philosophy is need-blind in admissions and aims to meet students’ financial need through a combination of gift aid (grants/scholarships), work-study employment, and student loans [oai_citation_attribution:35‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/types/index.html#:~:text=Meeting%20the%20cost%20of%20an,not%20affect%20the%20admission%20decision). A typical low-income package will include generous grant aid and a work-study job opportunity, with remaining need often filled by a subsidized Direct Loan. Students must submit the FAFSA or California Dream Act Application by the priority deadline (March 2) to be considered for all need-based programs. To maximize aid, low-income students should apply on time, submit any required documents, and also search for outside scholarships that can supplement UCSD’s aid. UC San Diego also offers programs like the Triton Food Pantry and emergency resources to support students from low-income backgrounds in managing living costs.",2024,University of California – Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan【18】; UCSD Financial Aid & Scholarships – Types of Financial Aid【42】
UC San Diego,Need-Based Aid (Middle-Income Families),"Middle-income undergraduates at UC San Diego can receive financial assistance, though typically less grant support than lower-income students. For California residents, the state’s Middle Class Scholarship program can significantly help families with incomes up to around $200,000 by covering a portion of university costs after other aid is applied [oai_citation_attribution:36‡finaid.ucsb.edu](http://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/scholarships/middle-class-scholarship#:~:text=The%20Middle%20Class%20Scholarship%20provides,25%20academic%20year%20only). This means that eligible middle-income UCSD students may see some of their loan or work-study requirements reduced thanks to the MCS program [oai_citation_attribution:37‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/mcs-updates/#:~:text=,be%20replaced%20with%20gift%20aid). In addition, students from middle-income families who demonstrate financial need might qualify for a Cal Grant A (which covers tuition for eligible middle-income Californians) [oai_citation_attribution:38‡financialaid.berkeley.edu](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/types-of-aid-at-berkeley/grants/cal-grants/#:~:text=California%E2%80%99s%20Investing%20in%20You), as well as institutional support if their FAFSA indicates remaining need. However, middle-income aid packages at UCSD often include a higher proportion of self-help: Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans, parent PLUS loans, and expected family contribution. California residents should always apply for aid by March 2 to be considered for programs like Cal Grants and MCS. Non-resident U.S. students are not eligible for California-funded aid (like Cal Grants or MCS) [oai_citation_attribution:39‡ucla.edu](https://www.ucla.edu/admission/financial-aid#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20Financial%20aid%20supported,based%20aid%20where%20available) and generally rely on federal loans and any merit scholarships.

UC San Diego,Merit-Based Aid,"UC San Diego offers several merit-based scholarships to recognize high academic achievement and other talents. The most prestigious is the UCSD Regents Scholarship, a purely merit-based award given to entering first-year and transfer students who have demonstrated academic excellence; it provides $5,000 per year for up to four years (a total of $20,000) and comes with special privileges like priority course enrollment and guaranteed housing [oai_citation_attribution:40‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/types/scholarships/regents-scholarships-for-entering-freshmen.html#:~:text=The%20Regents%20Scholarship%2C%20based%20on,plus%20other%20special%20privileges) [oai_citation_attribution:41‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/types/scholarships/regents-scholarships-for-entering-freshmen.html#:~:text=scholarship%20awarded%20to%20UC%20undergraduate,plus%20other%20special%20privileges). Another major award is the Chancellor’s Scholarship, which is awarded to outstanding California resident freshmen based on merit and financial need – it offers up to $5,000 per year (renewable for 4 years) for students who maintain eligibility [oai_citation_attribution:42‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/types/scholarships/chancellors-scholarships-for-entering-freshmen.html#:~:text=UC%20San%20Diego%20awards%20Chancellor%27s,special%20privileges%20as%20outlined%20below) [oai_citation_attribution:43‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/types/scholarships/chancellors-scholarships-for-entering-freshmen.html#:~:text=,Educational%20environment%20and%20economic%20background). UCSD also has other merit scholarships such as the Ellen and Roger Revelle Scholarship (a $10,000 award over four years for top freshmen) [oai_citation_attribution:44‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/types/scholarships/entering-freshmen.html#:~:text=Ellen%20and%20Roger%20Revelle%20Scholarship,based) and various restricted scholarships that target students with specific interests or backgrounds. Merit scholarships are very competitive and are awarded through the admissions process; no separate application is required for Regents or Chancellor’s scholarships (students are automatically considered based on their UC application) [oai_citation_attribution:45‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/types/scholarships/regents-scholarships-for-entering-freshmen.html#:~:text=How%20to%20Apply). To retain these scholarships, students must uphold the stipulated GPA (often around 3.0) and full-time enrollment each year. UCSD encourages students to also pursue outside scholarships to supplement any institutional awards, and provides resources to help locate private scholarships. Emphasizing your academic accomplishments, leadership roles, and unique experiences in your application can improve your chances for merit-based awards at UCSD.",2024,UCSD Financial Aid & Scholarships – Scholarships for Entering Students【31】; UCSD Financial Aid & Scholarships – Regents & Chancellor’s Scholarships【28】
UC San Diego,International Student Aid,"UC San Diego, like other UC campuses, offers little to no financial aid for international undergraduate students. International students on F-1/J-1 visas are not eligible to apply for UCSD’s university, state, or federal financial aid programs [oai_citation_attribution:46‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/applying/international-students/index.html#:~:text=International%20students%20who%20have%20been,sources%20in%20their%20home%20countries). Admitted international undergraduates must certify that they have sufficient funds available to cover all tuition, fees, and living expenses for their studies (on the order of tens of thousands of dollars per year) [oai_citation_attribution:47‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/applying/international-students/index.html#:~:text=International%20students%20who%20have%20been,sources%20in%20their%20home%20countries). In practice, this means UCSD expects international students to self-fund their education. The university does provide guidance on potential funding sources: UCSD’s International Students & Programs Office and the Financial Aid Office direct students to external scholarships and resources geared toward international students [oai_citation_attribution:48‡fas.ucsd.edu](https://fas.ucsd.edu/applying/international-students/index.html#:~:text=Many%20graduate%20departments%20award%20limited,students%20can%20check%20these%20sources). However, UCSD’s own merit scholarships (such as Regents and Chancellor’s) are generally restricted to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or AB540-eligible students, so international students are usually not recipients of those awards. International students may consider private education loans (which require a U.S. co-signer) or scholarships from organizations in their home country to help finance their UCSD education. They can also work on campus up to 20 hours a week as allowed by visa rules to earn some supplemental income. Ultimately, because UC San Diego cannot offer need-based aid to international undergraduates, affordability planning and securing funding in advance is essential for international students.",2024,UCSD Financial Aid & Scholarships – Information for International Students【27】; University of California – Financial Aid for International Students【58】
