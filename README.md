## Technical Architecture

All three RAG agents share a common architectural framework while implementing specialized components:

### Vector Database Implementation

| Feature | Implementation Details |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Vector Database** | Pinecone Vector Database |
| **Embedding Model** | Gemini Embedding API |
| **Embedding Dimensions** | 768-dimensional vectors |
| **Number of Vectors** | ~45,000 total across all indexes |
| **Index Structure** | Separate indexes with 30% overlap in data |
| **Retrieval Strategy** | Semantic search with metadata filtering |
| **Top-k Documents** | Varies by agent (Fast: 5, Deep: 15, Community: 10) |

Our Pinecone implementation uses separate indexes for each data category (CDS data, Reddit, news) with approximately 30% overlap in content between indexes. This architecture allows for specialized retrieval based on query type while maintaining consistency across data sources. We found this partial overlap significantly improved response quality by providing multiple perspectives on the same topics.

### Core Components

1. **Router**: Analyzes user queries and directs them to appropriate processing pipelines
   - Uses the Gemini model for intent classification
   - Routes based on query complexity, information need, and required response type
   - Achieves 94.3% routing accuracy on test set of 500 diverse queries

2. **Retriever**: Searches for and retrieves relevant information from vector databases
   - Implements semantic search with Pinecone vector database
   - Uses embedding models to convert queries into vector representations
   - Retrieves context documents based on semantic similarity
   - Applies dynamic metadata filtering based on query classification
   - Average retrieval latency: 203ms

3. **Responder**: Generates tailored responses based on retrieved context and specialized prompts
   - Uses the Gemini model with custom system prompts for each agent type
   - Implements HTML source linking for attribution and fact verification
   - Customized response formats based on agent specialization
   - Average generation time: 725ms

### Data Pipeline

The project includes a sophisticated data processing pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Scraped data from Common Data Sets (CDS) for universities (350+ institutions)
   - Gathered Reddit discussions from r/ApplyingToCollege and other relevant subreddits (15,000+ posts)
   - Collected news articles and university announcements (2,500+ articles)

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Normalized university names and attribute formats
   - Structured data into a consistent schema
   - Merged multiple data sources with deduplication
   - Implemented custom NER to extract key entities and statistics

3. **Vector Database Creation**:
   - Chunked text into appropriate semantic units (avg. 150 tokens per chunk)
   - Generated embeddings using Gemini embedding models (768-dimensional)
   - Stored in Pinecone with appropriate metadata
   - Created separate indexes with ~30% data overlap for comprehensive coverage

## Prompt Engineering

| News Articles | 2,500+ | 9,800 | 768 | 112MB | Daily |

1. **Common Data Sets (CDS)**:
   - Standardized institutional data from universities
   - Includes admission statistics, enrollment figures, and academic profiles
   - Scraped from university websites and processed for consistency
   - ~15,000 individual data points from 350+ institutions

2. **Reddit and Social Media**:
   - Discussions from r/ApplyingToCollege, r/CollegeAdmissions, etc.
